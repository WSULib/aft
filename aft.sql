For some, classroom management, \r\nfascinating lessons, student involvement, \r\nand adapting the curriculum are second \r\nnature. These teachers almost seem \r\nborn to the art of teaching. \r\n\r\nOn the opposite end, there are-teachers \r\nwho know they need to improve but are virtually \r\nhelpless to do so._They stand in front of \r\nthe classroom every day and don\'t understand \r\nwhy their students are riot engaged. \r\nThey may be brand new, fresh out of college \r\npeople who aren\'t secure with the myriad \r\nskills of teaching; they may be tenured professionals \r\nwho have somehow slipped through \r\nthe cracks and are aware that they do not get \r\nthe help they need from the standard \r\nsources. The traditional hierarchy has failed \r\nthem, and they are paralyzed in terms of \r\nseeking new and successful methodologies. \r\n\r\nIn a peer assistance program, expert colleagues \r\nsupport these struggling teachers, \r\npassing on their professional abilities and \r\nclassroom techniques. The cornerstone of \r\nthis program is helping students succeed by \r\nhelping colleagues succeed. \r\n\r\nWHAT PRECEPTS AND PROVISIONS \r\n\r\nSHOULD BE INCLUDED IN YOUR \r\n\r\nPROGRAM POLICY? \r\n\r\nA planning team of negotiators, which \r\nmay include those who eventually serve on \r\nthe program\'s governing panel, will determine \r\nthe mission, vision, ang goals of the \r\n\r\n\r\nPEER INTERVENTION PROGRAM MANUAL \r\n\r\nprogram. Either the panel or your planning \r\nteam draws up a program policy to which all \r\nmembers agree. Try to have your program \r\npolicy included in your bargaining agreement \r\n(contract) because this formalizes its \r\nprinciples and processes. \r\n\r\nThe planning team or panel will want to \r\ndetermine the qualifications and composition \r\nof the intervention staff, their length of \r\nservice, who will be served by your program, \r\nwhether your program will be confidential \r\nand voluntary and/or evaluative, and the \r\ninclusion of support staff (the alternative \r\ncareers liaison). Parameters of length of \r\ntime for intervention may include a period \r\nof administrative nonevalua+.ion. Acopy of \r\nthe collective bargaining agreement covering \r\nNew York City\'s Peer Intervention \r\nProgram appears in Appendix I at the end of \r\nthis chapter. \r\n\r\nHOW DID THE NYC TEAM DECIDE \r\n\r\nTHESE ISSUES? \r\n\r\nThree aspects form the cornerstone of \r\nthe success of NYC\'s program. First, when \r\npeople volunteer to participate, they are \r\nacknowledging their need. That is a given in \r\nmost self-help programs. \r\n\r\nSecond, confidentiality establishes a \r\nfirm basis for a participant\'s trust and risktaking. \r\nProgress is smoother when a parti~ipating \r\nteacher knows that the works and discussions \r\nwith the intervenor and/or the \r\nalternative careers liaison will not appear in \r\nany school record and that ne outsider \r\n(administrator or colleague) is privy to it \r\nParticipants who, from the start, may feel \r\nshame in admitting defects and drficits know \r\n\r\ntheir struggles go no further than the intervenor, \r\na caring colleague devoted to addressing \r\nissues in private. \r\n\r\nThird, PIP\'s program is nonevaluative \r\nand nonpunitive. Intervenors are nonjudg. \r\nmental. Their belief in the participants\' ability \r\nto improve their teaching skills is virtually \r\nthe only judgment they express. In the end, \r\nthe intervenor\'s role is not to determine \r\nwhether the principal should get rid of the \r\nparticipants or whether they are \"good\" or \r\n\"bad.\" The program helps them with what \r\nthey determined themselves: that their teaching \r\ncan be improved. \r\n\r\nWhen these provisions become district \r\npolicy, conditions are more likely to be constant \r\nfor everyone affected. \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ·6/ Appendix I \r\n\r\nT\r\nT\r\nhe Board and Union recognize that \r\ninstructional services should be delivered \r\nby a highly qualified and motivat\r\n\r\n\r\ned staff, accorded the respect and profession, \r\nal treatment to which they are entitled. \r\n\r\nToward that end the Board and the \r\nUnion have agreed to seek resources and to \r\nprovide peer assistance on a voluntary confidential \r\nbasis to staff who have completed \r\nprobation and who believe that their teaching \r\ncompetence will benefit from that assistance \r\nin the manner provided below: \r\n\r\n1. The Peer Intervention Panel shall be \r\ncomposed of nine members, six of \r\nwhom shall be selected by the Union \r\nand three of whom shall be administrators \r\nselected by the Board.. \r\n2. This Panel will set qualifications and \r\nprocedures for the selection of intervenors, \r\nan alternative careers liaison \r\nand a coordinator of the program. \r\nThe Panel shall advertise, as needed, \r\n, \r\nthe intervenor, coordinator and alternative \r\ncareers liaison positions on a \r\ncitywide basis, posting the qualifications \r\nand procedures previously \r\ndeveloped. The program\'s professional \r\nstaff shall be selected in accordance \r\nwith the posted procedure. \r\n\r\n3. The Panel will also design and continually \r\nmonitor a professional development \r\nprogram that enables the selected \r\nstaff to meet the goals set forth \r\nabove. \r\n4. The intervenors shall serve for a fouryear \r\nterm. \r\n5. Any teacher who has a reasonable \r\nbasis for needing such assistance \r\nand/or receives a U-rating or formal \r\nwarning may request assistance from \r\nPEER INTERVENTION PROGRAM MANUAL \r\n\r\nthe peer intervention program, in \r\n\r\nwriting on a form promulgated by the \r\n\r\nPanel. The Panel will .review requests \r\n\r\nand promptly notify the teacher of its \r\n\r\ndetermination as to whether assis\r\n\r\n\r\ntance will be provided in that case. \r\n\r\nSuch communications will be kept \r\n\r\ncompletely confidential. \r\n\r\n6. The intervenor will develop a plan to \r\nassist the participating teacher tailored \r\nto the specific needs of that \r\nteacher and will work with the \r\nteacher directly for not more than one \r\nyear. \r\n7. For three months following the start \r\nof the intervention period, supervisors \r\nwill not evaluate or observe the participating \r\nteacher. However, supervisors \r\nwill otherwise continue to exercise \r\ntheir responsibilities. \r\n8. The Board, the Union, and the participating \r\nteacher agree that for any disciplinary \r\naction other than an appeal \r\nof a previous U-rating, all time limitations \r\nwithin which to bring such \r\nactions will be tolled for the threemonth \r\nperiod in which the supervisor \r\ndoes not evaluate or observe the participating \r\nteacher. For such U-rating \r\nappeals, the parties agree that the \r\ntime limitations are tolled for the \r\nentire period of intervention. \r\n9. All communications between the \r\nintervenor and the participating \r\nteacher shall be completely confidential. \r\nAs a condition of involvement in \r\nthe program, all participants in the \r\nprogram, including the intervenor \r\nand the participating teacher, must \r\nconsent to the confidentiality provisions \r\nset forth in this paragraph. The \r\nBoard and Union agree that the inter\r\n\r\n\r\nvenor, or any other person involved in \r\n\r\nthe peer intervention program shall \r\n\r\nnot be subpoenaed by the Board or \r\n\r\nthe Union or caIled,to testify, produce \r\n\r\ndocuments or participate in any other \r\n\r\nway concerning the intervention in \r\n\r\nany proceeding involving the partici\r\n\r\n\r\npating teacher, including potential \r\n\r\nsubsequent proceedings under \r\nSection 3020-a of the education law. \r\nNo arbitrator, in any proceeding \r\nunder the parties\' control, shall \r\naccept evidence regarding such communications. \r\n\r\n\r\n10. Except as otherwise herein provided, \r\nthe Union, the Board or any participating \r\nteacher may exercise any constitutional, \r\nstatutory, regulatory or \r\ncontractual right otherwise provided \r\n\'by law, regulation or contract \r\n11. The Board agrees to make available \r\non a best efforts basis alternative \r\ncareer opportunities for teachers who \r\ndecide to leave the teaching profession \r\nin the course of or following \r\nihtervention. \r\n12. AdmiIjlstrative procedures for effectuation \r\nof these provisions will be formulated \r\nby the Panel in consultation \r\nwith the Board and the Union and \r\nthereafter distributed by the Panel. \r\n13. These procedures relate solely to \r\nissues of competency and no other \r\ngrounds of discipline. \r\n14. The acts of the Panel, intervenor, \r\ncoordinator, Union and Board shall \r\nbe final. \r\n\r\n8/ Chapter Two \r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT\'S THE PURPOSE OF A PANEL? \r\n\r\nThe panel, or policy board, plans and \r\noversees policy governing the workings of a \r\nteacher-to-teacher assistance program. The \r\npanel sets qualifications and procedures for \r\nselecting program staff, advertising vacancies, \r\nand selecting intervenors and other \r\nstaff. It is responsible for designing and monitoring \r\na continuous training program for \r\nthe program\'s professional staff. In addition, \r\nthe panel reviews and determines which \r\nteachers will receive assistance through the \r\nprogram. In New York City, the panel has \r\nestablished the criteria for eligibility; it .has \r\ndelegated to the staff the task of selecting \r\nparticipants who meet those parameters. \r\n\r\nWHO SHOULD BE REPRESENTED ON \r\nTHE PANEL AND WHY? \r\n\r\nTo reflect the program\'s collaborative \r\nnature, the panel should include representatives \r\nof the local administrative hierarchy as \r\nwell as members of the community of teachers. \r\nBecause this type of program is defined \r\nas an assistance program that empowers \r\nteachers, the majority of representatives on \r\nthe panel should be certified, teaching pedagogues. \r\nTeachers may include classroom \r\npractitioners, curriculum specialists, or other \r\nschool-based personneL Administrative representatives \r\nmay include school board officials, \r\nsuperintendent(s), principal(s), and/or \r\ndistrict-level staff. \r\n\r\nAlthough individual members of the \r\npanel should have a proven record of flexibility \r\nand interpersonal skills, they also should \r\nreflect a diversity of experience and expertise. \r\nPanelists must make a strong commit-\r\n\r\nPEER INTERVENTION P.ROGRAM MANUAL \r\n\r\nment of time and energy to create and govern \r\nthe program. \r\n\r\nWHAT\'S THE MIX ON tHE NEW YORK \r\nCITY PANEL? \r\n\r\nThe NYC PIP panel is composed of six \r\nteachers appointed by the president of the \r\nUnited Federation of Teachers (the local bargaining \r\nagent) and three administrative representatives \r\nchosen by the chancellor of the \r\nNew York City Board of Education. \r\n\r\nChapter Three \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\n\r\ni \r\ni \r\n\r\nIv \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\n-i \r\n\r\nWHAT SHOULD WE LOOK FOR WHEN \r\nHIRING OUR COORDINATOR? \r\n\r\nOnce a policy panel is in place to determine \r\nand oversee the basic principles and \r\ngovernance of the program, its main task will \r\nbe to select and hire the coordinator, intervenors, \r\nand the alternative careers liaison. \r\nSuccessful candidates must be pedagogically \r\nskilled and sensitive to the precarious status \r\nof the participating teachers. \r\n\r\nThe first step should be choosing an \r\neffective coordinator who can aid in developing \r\ndesirable qualifications and job profiles \r\nof potential intervenors and the alternative \r\ncareers liaison. \r\n\r\nBecause this is a program driven by the \r\nprinciples of peer support, the coordinator \r\nshould also be a teacher.he/she should have \r\nextensive outstanding experience as a \r\nteacher, a staff developer and a team-builder. \r\nSince the coordinator serves as liaison \r\nbetween the professional association, the \r\nlocal board of education, and the \r\npanel,he/she should be knowledgeable of \r\nthe system at J;rge and the formal and informal \r\nnetworks in place. The coordinator \r\nshould be conversant with the precepts of \r\nadult learning, peer coaching, and staff \r\ndevelopment strategies. In addition, since the \r\ncoordinator negotiates situations outside the \r\nparticipant/inter-venor relationship,he/she \r\nmust come to the job with strong interpersonal \r\nskills. (See Appendix 11.) . \r\n\r\nWHAT SHOULD WE LOOK FOR IN \r\n\r\nINTERVENORS? \r\n\r\nIntervenors share many of the qualities \r\nof the coordinator. extensive successful \r\nteaching experience in a variety of grade levels \r\nand subjects, a strong knowledge base, \r\neffective interpersonal skills, and an ability to \r\nbe reflective. Since intervenors design individualized \r\nplans for the participants\' success, \r\nthe successful applicant has experience with \r\nadult learners and an array of coaching techniques \r\nfrom which he/she can draw. (See \r\nAppendix III.) \r\n\r\nDO INTERVENORS NEED SPECIAL \r\n\r\nTRAINING? \r\n\r\nYes. The need for continual in-house \r\nand consultative special training is two-fold. \r\nAdults have years of habits and experiences \r\nthat must be honored, and a peer assistance \r\nprogram must also senSitively acknowledge \r\nthat adults learn differently from children. \r\nIntervenors need to learn how to build trusting \r\nrelationships with participants so that \r\nthey will be open to taking risks and experimenting \r\nwith strategies they\'ve never used \r\nbefore. \r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the adult learning \r\nprocess, intervenors need to be trained in \r\ncoaching methods, observing, and conferencing \r\ntechniques. They also must be able to \r\nbuild rapport, trust, and self-esteem with and \r\nin their teacher clients. Recognizing the variety \r\nof learning styles particular to adults . \r\nallows the intervenor to direct strategies to \r\nthe participants in ways they can adopt easily. \r\nIntervenors also must have access to the current \r\nresearch to share with teacher clients. \r\n\r\n\r\n10/ Chapter Three \r\n\r\nIn addition, intervenors sometimes work \r\nwith teachers in many different grades or disciplines \r\nand in schools that require particular \r\nor specialized teaching strategies_ \r\nWorking in a school that emphasizes cooperative \r\nlearning or portfolio assessment \r\nrequires the intervenor be familiar with the \r\nstrategies that make these work. Whole language, \r\nmultiple intelligences, Open Courtintervenors \r\nmust be knowledgeable of their \r\nprocedures and their philosophies to assure \r\nclassroom success_ \r\n\r\nA list of significant training experiences \r\nin which NYC intervenors have participated \r\nfollows in Appendix V_ \r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE JOB OF THE ALTERNA\r\n\r\n\r\nTIVE CAREERS LIAISON? \r\n\r\nDespite the best efforts of both the peer \r\nintervenor and the participating teacher, \r\nsometimes it becomes evident that the participant \r\nis not able to improve his/her teaching \r\nskills_ When both intervenor and participant \r\nagree to consider a career change, the alternative \r\ncareers liaison (ACLl can determine if \r\na referral is appropriate. Then the ACL \r\nshould schedule appointments with the pa~ticipant \r\nto help with a humane and dignified \r\nexit from teaching. Unlike the intervenor, \r\nwhose main focus is to help the participant \r\nbecome successful in the classroom, the ACL \r\nfocuses on the participant\'s dignified and \r\nhumane exit from a teaching career_ \r\n\r\nParticipating teachers working with the \r\nACL have usually already made a decision to \r\nlook into working outside the classroom_ \r\nOften they are concerned about their continued \r\nusefulness in the community and fearful \r\nof the unknown possibilities something new \r\naffords.

Your application \r\nand the ensuing conversation with a member of our staff did not indicate that the need to \r\nimprove your instructional competence is a primary concern fllr you. Therefore, we feel \r\nthat at this time the support you need may better be provided under some other aegis and \r\nhope that the sugg~stions offered by our staff member are of help. Please feel free to noti-_ \r\nfy us if yoyr plans should change. \r\n\r\nr \r\n\r\nWe hope the balance of the year will be a gratifying and productive one for you and \r\nyour students. -\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nClare Cohen \r\n\r\nCoordinator \r\n\r\nCC:ic \r\n--------~~--------.----~----~---------\r\n\r\n\r\n-\'-,\r\n\r\nPEER INTERVENTION PROGRAM MANUAL \r\n\r\n.. ~ \r\n\r\n\r\n42 / Chapter Six \r\n\r\nChapter 6: SCHEDUUNG \r\n\r\nHOW ARE PARTICIPANTS ASSIGNED\' \r\nTO INTERVENORS? \r\n\r\nOnce the participant is accepted into the \r\nprogram, the structured telephone screening: \r\ninterview determines the prospective client\'s \r\nneeds, interests, and fundamental agenda \r\nExtrinsic areas of concern (health or family \r\nmatters) also affect how the participant will \r\nwork with an intervenor. \r\n\r\nThe guidelines to determine a match \r\nwith an interVenor include the area of certification \r\nand expertise, grade level,.and geo--graphicallocation. \r\nSuch a match ensures the \r\neffectiveness of the program, and every effort \r\nshould be made to coordinate these particulars. \r\nWhen they cannot be matched ideally, \r\ncollegial consultations are needed. \r\n\r\nSince most issues are related to classroom \r\nmanagement, however, intervenors are \r\nusually adept at coaching needy teachers, \r\n.regardless of differing subject areas. But \r\nyour program sh(:lUld try to maintain constancy \r\nin grade levels whenever possible. \r\n\r\nHOW SHOULD INTERVENORS \r\n\r\nSCHEDULE THEIR TIME? . \r\n\r\nIntervenors\' schedules reflect whether \r\nthey are full: or part-time, available for full \r\ndays, and how much time each may spend \r\nwith a participant \r\n\r\n\r\nSince most of the intervention process \r\n\r\noccurs during the school workday, with addi\r\n\r\n\r\n.tional time spent before andlor after class, \r\n\r\n\'scheduling too many participants\'for not \r\n\r\nin addition, time must be aIlotted for the \r\npeer assistance staff to write documentation, \r\nattend regular staff conferences and meetings, \r\nand participate in professional development \r\nconferences. \r\n\r\nSufficient time for planning, observing, \r\nand conferrirlg must be included for each participant \r\n. \r\n\r\nHQW DOES NYC PIP SCHEDULE ITS \r\n\r\nINTERVENORS? \r\n\r\n.... New York City intervenors are full-time \r\n\r\nstaff members, each of whom works with \r\n.four participants at a time. Because inter\r\n\r\n\r\nvenors are teachers modeling empowerment, \r\n\r\nthey schedule themselves with the teachers \r\n\r\nthey serve as they see fit \r\n\r\nHowever, the program allows.the equivalent \r\nof one full day for each participant,\' \r\nalthough the time may be split into, for \r\nexample, participant A in the morning of one \r\nday, and participant B in the afternoon, and \r\nthen \"flipping\" the schedule on a subsequent \r\nday. This allows intenienors to work with a \r\nparticipant on more than one occasion in a \r\ngiven week, and considers \'the differing \r\nneeds and responses of teachers and students \r\nresulting from differing daily programming. \r\n\r\n\r\nSO Tl-IAT\'5 FOUR DAYS. WHAT\'S ON \r\n\r\nTH E FIFTH DAY? \r\n\r\nThe.fifth day of the week is used for con-\r\ns~ltation, conferences, staff development for \r\n\r\nThey need time to discuss and consult about. \r\nthe issues raised by their clients. They also \r\nneed time to plan workshops and events during \r\nwhich the participating teachers are invited \r\nto meet in a large group, sometimes with \r\noutside consultants. In New York City, presentation \r\ntopics include time management \r\nand various approaches to discipline, concerns \r\ncommon to most, if not all, participants. \r\nSince the program staff is often asked \r\nto deliver presentations at forums sponsored \r\nby local or national professional organiza: \r\ntions, the time is utilized for collaboration on \r\nsuch projects as welL . \r\n\r\nenough time does both intervenor all.dparti~_~ intervenors, and casework.

The intervenor starts to \r\nconsider a tentative improvement plan. The \r\nprocess of bonding and bwlding trust begins \r\nhere, as the two colleagues anticipate their \r\nfirst day together in the participant\'s classroom. \r\n\r\n\r\n. The intervenor shares the focus and \r\n. vision of the program as it pertains to the \r\n\r\nparticipant Together they will collaborate on \r\ndeciding the date of the intervenor\'s first \r\nvisit to .the classroom and how the inter. \r\nvenor will be introduced to the cl~s and colleagues. \r\n(In a small district where everybody \r\nknows everyone else\'s job and title, stress \r\nthe confidentiality of your relationship. In a \r\nlarger district, what often works is, \"Ms.__ \r\n\r\nis working on a project with me about how \r\nteachers teach and how students learn.\") \r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE INTERÂ· \r\n\r\nVENOR FIRST ENTERS THE SCHOOL \r\nBUILDING? \r\n\r\nThe first stop is the principal\'s office. \r\nThe intervenor presents the confidential letÂ· \r\nter of introduction (see Appendix XV) and . \r\nexplains the goals and values of the intervenÂ· \r\ntioh model the intervenor\'s role and the \r\n\r\n-lisnes thecoi.niilon-ground between the goals \r\nof the program and those of the school, disÂ· \r\npelling fears that the program might be a \r\nprotection for incompetent teachers. Rather, \r\nit is a program to support teachers in their \r\ndelivery of effective.instruction. This clarification \r\nusually allays any concerns the principal \r\nmay have. \r\n\r\nIf the program policy precludes evalua~ \r\ntion or observation of the participant by a \r\nsupervisor at the beginning of intervention, \r\nthe principal continues to be responsible for \r\nall other supervisory obligations, such as \r\nmonitoring lateness, patrols, student and \r\nschool safety. Any <;langerous situation continues \r\nto require the principal\'s prompt \r\naction. \r\n\r\nThe principal can help the intervenor \r\nobtain access to .such resources as a teleÂ· \r\nphone for a dally call to headquarters, photocopier, \r\ncoat closet, bathroom key, and parkÂ· \r\n. ing space. With theÂ· agreement of the partici\r\nÂ·pating teacher, he/she also can identify key \r\npersonnel in the building with whom the \r\n\r\nWHAT DOES A TYPICAL DAY LOOK \r\nLIKE? \r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the interview with the principal, \r\nthe intervenor meets with the participating \r\nteacher. Ideally, he/she will have an . \r\nunassigned period; if not, the intervenor will \r\nobserve classroom interaction, teaching and \r\nlearning styles, and the work atmosphere. \r\n\r\nDuring the unassigned period, the intervenor \r\nshould respond to any questions that \r\narise. He/she will use this time to continue \r\n\r\n\r\n_ \r\nthe trust-building begun at the off-site meetÂ· \r\ning, reinforcing the positive choice the \r\nteacher has made to participate in the intervention \r\nprocess. \r\n\r\nThe intervenor spends the first day \r\n\"shadowing\" t4e participating teacher, \r\nbecoming familiar with other staff members, . \r\nthe schedule, the students, and the culture of \r\nthe school. \r\n\r\nThe focus of the firSt day is familiarization \r\nand data collection. The intervenor \r\nbegins to leary the perspectives of the partie-. \r\nipant, adminis\'trators, and the classroom stuÂ· \r\ndents.. The intervenor models professional_ \r\ncollegiality and appropriate attitudes as an \r\nadditional resource to both the teacher and \r\nthe school. \r\n\r\n1,. \r\n\r\n\r\n46/ Chapter Eight \r\n\r\nChapter 8: \'DAY-TO\'-DAY FUNCTIONS \r\n\r\nWHAT ARE SOME STRATEGIES \r\n\r\nINTERVENORS USE TO HELP \r\n\r\nTEACHERS IMPROVE? \r\n\r\nMeaningful professional development. \r\nincludes an extensive sample of strategies \r\nthat address the instruction ofstudents. The \r\nintervenor employs varied learning \r\napproaches to help a participant acquire \r\nthese strategies. Some suggestions are: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Modeling demonstration lessons. \r\nâ€¢ Observing and providing objective \r\nfeedback. \r\nâ€¢ Photographing, videotapi~i; and \r\n\'audiotaping. \r\nâ€¢ Providing\'practice opportunities. \r\nâ€¢ Introducing motivational techniques. \r\nfor students. \r\nâ€¢ Improving the appearance of the \r\nclassroom; \r\nâ€¢ Developing lesson plans ahd classroom \r\nmanagement systems. \r\nâ€¢ Role-playing activities. \r\nâ€¢ Researching and pt;!cticing new tech\r\nÂ· niques for effective teaching. \r\n.\' Attending after-schoolÂ·tr.aining workshops \r\nahd seminars together. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Viewing and listening to professional \r\n.video and audio tapes. \r\nâ€¢ Facilitating and participating in inter.\r\nschool or interclass visitations. \r\nâ€¢ Attending professional conferences \r\noutside of school. \r\nFollowing each activity shoula be a \r\n\r\n\"debriefing\" during which the participating \r\nteacher is encouraged to discuss what \r\nworked and what could be changed. This \r\nongoing effort is most critical to the iilterven-\r\n\r\nHOW DO INTERVENORS BUILD \r\nRELATIONSHIPS WITH PARTICIPANTS? \r\n\r\nSince much of the work participants \r\nmust do requires them to make profound \r\nchanges in: perspective and performance, \r\nintervenors continually want to bolster their \r\nconfidence. This is often the first opportunity \r\nparticipants have ever had to discuss their \r\nperceptions of their own deficiencies with \r\nsomeone who believes they can improve. \r\nTherefore, time must be devoted to expanÂ· \r\nsion of trust \r\n\r\nOften participating teachers exhibit fear \r\nof letting go of their destructive practices, \r\nand correcting these practices may conjure \r\nnegative behaviors in them. To reduce their \r\ndiscomfort, intervenors model behavioral \r\nand attitudinal changes one or two at a time \r\nand applaud them .each step of the way. \r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to identify positive \r\nbehaviors and. attitudes in participants.. \r\nHowever, intervenors should make everY \r\neffort at the beginning of each conference to \r\ninform them of some improvement or positive \r\naction. Then they may suggest ways in \r\nwhich to build on this improvement. \r\nNonjudgmental approaches help participants \r\nfeel safe so that ultimately they can take . \r\nrisks on their own. \r\n\r\nHOW CAN INTERVENORS DO THAT? \r\n\r\nTo help a participant feel the success \r\n\r\ntoward which he/she is working, intervenors \r\nuse techniques that strive to reduce isolation \r\nand bolster confid~nce. These are some ideas \r\n\r\ntion process in which instructioilal\'cliange _._~that.have.worked.m.the.NYC model:. .. ---------must \r\nbe made. â€¢ Celebrate successes through small \r\n\r\nrewards-token gifts or a shared meal. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Provide emotional support for the \r\nparticipant\'s whole life experience. \r\nâ€¢ Clarify limits and the significance of \r\nconfidentiality pertaining to the program. \r\nâ€¢ Maintain the participant\'s motivation \r\neven after the supervisor returns to \r\nobserve and evaluate. \r\nâ€¢ Use conflict mediation and negotiation.\r\nskills. \r\nâ€¢ Interact with the supervisor on a participant\'s \r\nbehalf when there is a violation \r\nof the program policy. \r\nâ€¢ Explore the participant\'s values. \' \r\nâ€¢ Develop a network of support among. \r\nfaculty in the school. \r\nâ€¢ Listen to \"seek to understand,\" notÂ· \r\nmerely to respond by telling \"what \r\nworked for you.\" \r\nDOES THE INTERVENOR ALWAYS \r\n\r\nWORK ALONE? \r\n\r\nAs the relationship between intervenor \r\n\'and participant grows, key persons are invited \r\nto participate in the pr()cess. Sometimes \r\nparticipants become willing to accept technical\'guidanc~\r\nfrom their supervisorsafier the \r\nintervenor stts down with the supervisor and\' \r\nparticipant and shows them how to talk to \r\neach other to solve problems. Others may \r\nwork with a buddy teacher in the same \r\nschool or with a coaching circle in which several \r\nteachers support each other. These \r\nwould have been inconceivable prior to intervention! \r\n\r\n\r\nYOU MAKE IT SOUND SO EASY. \r\nIt isn\'t \r\n\r\nthe complex nature of a participant\'s problems \r\nmay sometimes interfere with addressing \r\nthe compound problems in a participant\'s \r\nclassroom. \r\n\r\nHOW DO INTERVENORS ENCOURAGE \r\nPARTICIPANTS TO REFLECT ON THEIR \r\nPRACTICE? \r\n\r\nAnother goal of the intervention program \r\nis to help \'teachers become reflective of \r\ntheir practices-to think about their thinking \r\nand activities in the classroom. Many people \r\nact without consideration and deliberation; a \r\npeer assistance program should teach participating \r\nteachers to think about the \"why\" of \r\nwhat they may do. This helps them to \r\nbecome more aware of the problems they \r\ncreate, identify areas of improvement, and \r\ncelebrate their successes. The process of \r\nreflection allows participants to \"own\" both \r\nthe Cause and the effect and allows them the \r\npower to foster change .. \r\n\r\nSome methods to engage participants in \r\nreflection ar~: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Observing, collecting and providing \r\nhard data and feedback. \r\nâ€¢ Engaging in pre-and post-observation \r\nconferences. \r\nâ€¢ Reviewing video and audio tapes of \r\nthe intervenor\'s and the participant\'s \r\nwork. _ ..\' \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nKeeping a journal and discussing written \r\nreflections. \r\nâ€¢ Identifying methods of assessment \r\nand examination of the participant\'s \r\nagenda. \r\nIT SOUNDS LIKE AN EVOLUTIONARY \r\nPROCESS FOR THE PARTICIPANT. \r\n\r\n-.. _.....--.. -----------.Sometimes the intervenor may become-\' .... -Â·Â· -\' .... \r\nfrustrated and experience a reduction in zest \' It is.

The second \r\nintervenor can observe the interaction \r\nbetween the intervenor and the teacher as \r\nwell as collect data about the participant\'s \r\nclassroom atmosphere and practices. This \r\npractice helps the intervenor choose a different \r\ncourse of action, if necessary. \r\n\r\nIntervenors consult over the phone with \r\nthe coordinator. Regular assessment of goals \r\nand achievements with the coordinator\'S \r\nhonest feedback helps to clarify objectives, \r\nidentify successes, and provide reminders \r\nthat the intervention process is continually \r\nproductive. The coordinator, whose job it is \r\nto maintain an overview, also is able to help \r\nthe intervenor see another dimension or \r\nseek another direction: InterVenors also may \r\n\"bring to the table\" during staff meetings \r\nthose baffling cases or Issues, inviting aÂ· \r\n\r\n.

If it happens; inter\r\n\r\n\r\nvenors review the causes to deterniine if the \r\n\r\nreasons are personal or professional. \r\n\r\nBecause program staff has traiIling in strateÂ· \r\n.gies of building collegial relationships and \r\n\r\nnegotiation skills, the intervenonhould clar-, \r\n\r\nify with the participant the reasonsÂ· for apply\r\n\r\n\r\ning for the program and negotiate some \r\n\r\nground rules based on achieving common \r\n-goals. Another intervenor 6i thecoordiilator-\r\n\r\n\r\nmay visit the teacher to consider fresh \r\n\r\napproaches. \r\n\r\nIfthe mismatch .continues, you may \r\nwant to change intervenors. Sometimes a different \r\nintervenor will work more effectively. \r\nBut this determination should come after \r\nother deliberate strategies are tried arid \r\nexhausted. (See next question.) \r\n\r\n\r\nAnother clear possibility is that the par.\r\nticipant suddenly exhibits a distinctly different \r\nagenda from the one he/she came inÂ· \r\nwith, and this agenda has no place in the \r\nprogram. For example, a. participant is selected \r\nbased on a request for help with class-\' \r\nroom management. AftEir a few sessions \r\ntogether, the intervenor discovers :that the \r\nrequest is a cloaked request to affirm use of \r\ncorporal punishment, which is against the \r\nlaw in New YorkÂ·and many other jurisdictions. \r\nUnfortunately, -intervention may have \r\nto end in this case. \r\n\r\nBUT SUPPOSE THE PARTICIPANT \r\nSTILL REMAINS RESISTANT TO \r\nIMPROVEMENT? \r\n\r\nThere are strategies intervenors can use \r\nto examine cause and effect, including: . \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Continue to discuss why he/she \r\napplied for intervention. Sometimes \r\nthe reasons change, and the intervenor \r\nshould be open to his/her \r\nassessments along the way. Provide \r\nreality checks, however. \r\nâ€¢ Sometimes a participant isn\'t ready to \r\nmake the quantum leap that the int-ervenor \r\nperceives as a small step. All \r\nchanges for us adults are mai.or, espe-\r\ncially if they affect the way we operate \r\nor think. . \r\nâ€¢ Be sure that the. goals are realistic. \r\nFor example, a teacher working in \r\nmany classrooms may not be able to \r\ndecorate a small comer of even one of \r\n.them. Ifa participant knows no student\'s \r\nname (anq. it\'s March!), telling \r\nhim/her to know them by next week \r\nmay not be achievable. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ If the participant is being asked to \r\nmake bJSic life chimges, this can be \r\nvery lliteatening, even when it is \r\nabout personal hygiene and neatness. \r\nAn extremely unkempt teacher needs \r\nto lie approached carefully, because . \r\nthis poor physical appearance may \r\nreflect a deeper issue, such as mental \r\nhealth or medical concerns. \r\nâ€¢ Review if the participant understands \r\nwhat is being asked of him/her. A \r\nsuggestion that is premature or out of \r\nreach may not be taken in the proper \r\nspirit. \r\n.-..--------------~--.----~---..-...-----.---.-.--\r\n\r\n\r\n1, \r\n\r\nHOW LONG DOES THE AVERAGE \r\n\r\nINTERVENTION LAST? \r\n\r\nA peer assistance program takes time to \r\nencourage change and success, and one calendar \r\nyear works well. This includes time \r\nover a summer so the participant may take \r\ncourses or do research, andallows the intervenor \r\nto help reInforce good habits of teaching. \r\nMost participants will take the full year, \r\nalthough some require only five or six \r\nmonths . \r\n\r\nSHOULD A PARTICIPANT HAVE AN \r\n\r\nINTERVENOR\'S HOME PHONE \r\nNUMBER? \r\n\r\nSometimes intervenors may give out their \r\nnumbers for reasons such as absence from \r\nwork or emergencies that crop 1.!p, or if they \r\nneed information and the participants must \r\nreturn the call. But it\'s best to set and inaintain \r\nguidelines (\"Don\'t call me before 6:00 a.m. \r\nor after 9:30 p.m.\"). \r\n\r\nDOES THE ACL HELP THE PARTICIPANT \r\nIN OTHER WAYS? \r\n\r\nThe most crucial aspect of the ACL\'s \r\nrole is to offer supportive counseling~ \r\nSometimes that may be a phone call to \r\nremind a participant of an appointment.or.an \r\nassignment; sometimes it may be a personal \r\nmeeting at the participant\'s school or the \r\nACL\'soffice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50 / Chapter Nine \r\n\r\n-, \r\n\r\nChapter 9: DOCUMENTATION \r\n\r\nIF THE PROGRAM IS CONFIDENTIAL, the superintendent of the school district \r\nWHY DO YOU NOTIFY PEOPLE Both letters are confidential. \r\nTHAT THE TEACHER IS GETTING \r\n\r\nThis letter serves several purposes. \r\nINTERVENTION?

Expedited 3020-a Procedure \r\nThe parties are in agreement that it is in the best interests of the school \r\nsystem and the teacher involved to expedite the proceedings under 3020a \r\nin a manner consistent with due process. The parties have therefore \r\nagreed to expedite the 3020-a proceedings in the following manner: \r\n\r\nJ.

TIle \r\nhearings shall be transcribed with the cost of transcription shared by the \r\nBoard and the Union. The cost of dailyand/or expedited transcripts shall \r\nbe shared equally by the parties if mutually requested, and by one party \r\nif not mutually requested.

The two conponents of this a9proach aro \r\n\r\nthe Intern Program and the Intervention Program. \r\n\r\nThe Intern Program is designed to offer the first year (intern) teacher the support, advice, \r\nand guidance necessary to maKe the first year\'s experience as successful and meaningful as \r\npossible. This suppor.t is provided by a peer (consulting teacher) who has been identified \r\nas a master teacher. This consultant has been released from regular classroom duties in \r\norder to direct and enhance the progress of the intern. The program allows the consulti~g \r\nteacher the time to conduct a complete and proper evaluation of the intern\'s 9rogress and \r\nultimate success (or lack of) in meeting the criteria of the Toiedo Public\' Schools for \r\nemployment. These standards and the step-by-step evaluation process are defined and outlined \r\nin The Toledo Plan of supervision, evaluation, and goal-setting. \r\n\r\nThe Intervention Program in the Toledo Public Schools is a cooperative effort on the part \r\nof union and managecent and is designed to assist non-probationary teachers who have been \r\nidentified as performing in a way so unsatisfactory that termination or improvement is \r\nimperative. The intervention process, an outgrowth of teacher and administrative concerns \r\nabout the quality of the teaching staff, begins after a joint reco~endation from the \r\nprincipal and the Federation building co~~ittee is sent to the Federation president and to \r\nthe assistant superintendent of personnel. A master teacher (intern consulting teacher) is \r\nassigned to the identified teacher who must then accept the consultant. \r\n\r\nSince ~ach intervention is unique, no standardized methods of raising teacher performance \r\n\r\nhave been adopted. Released from official classroom duties and operating without.tine \r\n\r\nrestraints, the intern consulting teacher nay use a wide variety of methods in order to \r\n\r\nraise teaching performance to a satisfactory level. \r\n\r\nCo~~unication is stressed throughout the intervention so that building committees and local \r\nad~inistrators remain knowledgeable about the format, progression and resolution of the \r\nintervention. \r\n\r\n~men the conSUltant feels that intervention is no longer necessary, the assistance ends, \r\nand depending upon the contractual status of the teacher in intervention, mandated and \r\nconfidential reports are filed with the Federation and the office of personnel. Once the \r\nappropriate reports are filed, it becomes the responsibility of management to act upon or \r\nignore the evaluations and/or the \"status report.\" \r\n\r\nThe Intervention Program has received wide acceptance locally â€¢. Teachers, administrators, \r\nand the co~~unity view it as a means to strengthen the teaching ranks. \r\n\r\nThe program is governed by a nine member \"review panel\" composed of five union appointees \r\nand four management appointees. The panel decides to accept or reject the evaluation \r\nrecommendations of the consulting teachers. The board of review also assigns consulting \r\nteachers for all other aspects of the progran. The recon~endatlons of the panel are sent \r\nto the superintendent who, under Ohio law, must reco~~end termination or contract renewal \r\nto the school Board.

Infonnation \r\n\r\nThe Toledo Public Schools Intern Program is designed to provide assistance and \r\nevaluation by outstanding experienced teachers for first year teachers without \r\nprevious experience. \r\n\r\nIn April, 1981, we advertised the position of intern teacher consultants in our \r\nstaff bulletin. We listed as qualifications, a minimum of five (5) years outstanding \r\nteaching service and requested that each of the applicants provide us \r\nwith four references --three references from teachers who were currently teaching \r\nin the same building as the applicant. and a recommendation from the building \r\nprincipal. We received 75 applications. After a preliminary paper screening, \r\nwe interviewed approximately 30 applicants for 15 intern teacher consultant \r\npositions. The teachers sel~cted had a variety of b~ckgrounds, including \r\nspecial education, physical education, elementary and secondary education.. The \r\nnumber of teachers actually needed to implement the program in the fall ofÂ· 181 \r\nwould depend on the. number of first year teachers that Toledo Public .s.chools \r\nhired. These 15 consultants attended a five day inservice session in August \r\nof 1981. \r\n\r\nThe consulting teachers are limited to three years actual.experience in the \r\nprogram after which they return to their regular classroom \'assignment. Each \r\nconsulting teacher works full-time in the program and is assigned no more than \r\nten interns. They meet with their interns before the opening of school and spend \r\na great deal of time observing classrooms and meeting with the interns after school. \r\nEach consulting teacher receives an additional $2,500 in salary. Consulting \r\nteachers attend all meetings of the Intern Board of Review which are held during \r\nthe school year. \r\n\r\nThe consulting teachers submit periodic reports to the Intern Board of Review \r\nregarding the status of each of the interns with whom they are working. During \r\nthe first year, the observation and subsequent evaluations are done solely by the \r\nconsulting teacher. The principal completes the principal\'s summary form (see \r\npage 11 of the Intern/Intervention/Evaluation book) and forwards it to the consulting \r\nteacher who shares the eval~ation with the intern. During the second \r\nyear of probation, it is the principalls responsibility to evaluate and make a \r\nrecommendation regarding\' the status of the intern.

It is designed to assist those seriously dysfunctional \r\nin performance unrelated to drug or alcohol abuse. \r\n\r\nIn Toledo, non-probationary teachers are third year teachers and beyond.\r\nToledo grants four-year provisional contracts until tenure is attained. \r\nTenure and a continuing contract are granted automatically. Hence, a \r\ncontinuing contract is available when the teacher obtains a professional or \r\npermanent certificate and completes three years (of the last five) service \r\nin the district. A professional certificate is granted when 27 months of \r\nsuccessful teaching experience under a provisional certificate is achieved \r\nand 18 graduate semeste~ hours beyond the bachelor\'s degree are ~arned. \r\nAfter probation, the only evaluation of teachers is one observation justprior to the renewal of a four-year contract. \r\n\r\nAn experienced teacher who is seriously dysfunctional is a potential \r\nintervention case. Identification can take place by the building principal \r\nor by the teachers through their Federation building committee which is \r\nelected annually. Before intervention can proceed, both the principal and \r\nthe Federation building committee must give their informal approval. If \r\neither party refuses, no intervention is authorized. If approvedinformally, a joint recommendation is sent to the president of the Toledo \r\nFederation of Teachers and to the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel. \r\nThese two people must then agree to authorize a formal intervention vote at \r\nthe school after receiving the jOint recommendation from the school. \r\n\r\nThe teacher having difficulty is informed by the Federation representative \r\nbefore the informal meeting that the building committee is going to discuss \r\nintervention. The teacher is extended the opportunity to meet with the \r\nbuilding committee separately, or with the committee and principal if that \r\nis his/her desire. During this meeting, the teacher has the opportunity to \r\nexplain why he/she feels the intervention should not go forward. \r\n\r\nThe Federation building committee must decide the union\'s position about \r\nthe i nterventi on by a secret ballot vote of the enti re committee whi ch \r\nincludes the building representative. After the formal vote is authorized \r\nbetween committee and principal their agreement makes intervention mandatorY. \r\nA letter of notification is delivered to the teacher specifying \r\n\r\n. \r\naeficiencies, assistance offered in the past, and the name of the consulting \r\nteacher assigned to the case. \r\n\r\nIncluded with this letter. is a form for use (within five days) if the \r\nteacher wishes to appeal the intervention. An appeal is heard by a law \r\n\r\n\r\n-over\r\n\r\n\r\n\\ \r\n, \r\n\r\n\r\nrl \r\n\r\nprofessor from the University of Toledo law school.

Other \r\n\r\nI \' \r\n\r\nI \r\nfl \r\n, \r\nmeetings do take place. The consultant has complete freedom to use whatev\r\n\r\n\r\nI l j \r\n\r\ner techniques are necessary to bring the teacher\'s performance back to \r\nacceptable district standards. No time limits are imposed on the\r\n\r\n-n \r\nconsultant. The career of the dysfunctional teacher rests in the hands of \r\n\r\n-t j \r\n\r\nthe consultant. \r\n\r\nri \r\nIntervention ends when performance has been brought to district standards, \r\n\r\nl J \r\nor when success has not been achieved after all reasonable efforts have \r\nfailed. (A typical intervention lasts about eighteen months.) At its \r\nconclusion, the consultant issues a \"status report\". The report is a \r\nfactual, documented history of the case. No recommendation is made. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe status report is forwarded to the personnel office and to the \r\nr \'1 Federation. Management then decides whether a termination hearing is \r\n\r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\nwarranted based on the report, and the union decides through its own \r\ninternal process whether to represent the teacher in a termination \r\nr \' proce~ding if that is the decision of management.\r\nI \r\n\r\n\r\nr.

Training \r\ntypically consists of four years ofcollege with a brief \r\nperiod of student teaching. Evaluation is hierarchical, \r\nwith periodic assessments based on limited observa\r\n\r\n\r\nl, tions by the school principal. \r\n\r\nWith the country\'s attention focused on teacher quality, \r\nthe conventional systems are increasingly being \r\ncalled into question. A number of states and localities \r\nare establishing new programs. One of the most interesting \r\n-and controversial-of the new proposals \r\nwas launched in Toledo, Ohio, in 1981. Called the Tole\r\n\r\n\r\ni do Plan, its emphasis is on professional development of \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nl \r\n\r\nte,achers, by teachers. Probably its most unique feature \r\nis that it gives teachers the controlling voice in the \r\nestablishment of teaching standards, the training and \r\nl screening of nC\\y teachers, and the identification of\r\n\r\nJ \r\n\r\nteachers in need of intense assistance. The Toledo Plan \r\nhas two components: the in~ern program and the intervention \r\nprogram., Through the intern program, all \r\nnewly hired teachers are assigned for their initial teach\r\n\r\n\r\n221 AMERICAN EDUCATOR \r\n\r\ning year to an experienced, expert teacher. These \"consulting \r\nteachers\" are releaSed from their regular duties \r\nand given responsibility for both the professional development \r\nand the evaluation of the interns. The intervention \r\nprogram establishes a process for identifying and \r\naiding veteran teachers who are experiencing severe \r\ndifficulties with their work. Both programs are overseen \r\nby a joint labor-management Review Panel on which \r\nteachers, through their union, hold a majority of the \r\nseats. \r\n\r\nThe major concepts behind the Toledo Plan originated \r\nwith Dal Lawrence, president of the Toledo Federation \r\nofTeachers. A former,high school history teacher, \r\nhe has been president ofthe Toledo local since 1967 \r\nand also serves as a member of the Executive Committee \r\nofthe Ohio Federation ofTeachers and as recording \r\nsecretary of the Toledo Area Council of the AFL-CIO. \r\n. Mr. Lawrence was interviewed by Liz McPike, editor \r\nof the American Educator. \r\n\r\nWe welcome the response of our readers and hope \r\nthe ideas presented will spark a lively debate. \r\n\r\nSPRING 1984 \r\n\r\n\r\nfl \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion: Obviously, the high quality and ability of \r\nthe consulting teachers are key elements of this program \r\nTo a large degree, the success of the program \r\nrests on their shoulders. .What qualities were }Iou looking \r\nf()r in the consulting teachers? \r\n\r\nrl \r\nrl \r\ntawrence: We were looking for several important \r\ncharacteristics: First of all, we wanted a good teacher. \r\nWe wanted someone that other people recognized as \r\nbeing an outstanding teacher. We wanted someone who \r\nwas good at human relations skills, good at communica\r\n\r\n\r\nJ tion. The last thing we wanted was to have a consulting \r\nteacher turn into a supervisor and be feared by the \r\ninterns. We also wanted someone who could write, \r\n\r\nn \r\nbecause consulting teachers have to write status re\r\n\r\n\r\nl J \r\nports, they have to write recommendations, they have \r\nto write clearly for the co!1ferences they have with their \r\ninterns, and so forth. We wanted to know how they \r\n\r\n, :J \r\nn LJ \r\nn reacted to stressful situations, to emergencies, to unforeseen \r\ncircumstances. Finally, we wanted to know \r\nwhether thev would be able to recommend that an \r\nintern not ~renewed for a second year if that\'s what \r\nthe situation called for. That\'s never easy to do, but at \r\nthe end of each one-year internship, we do have to \r\ngrapple with that decision. The consulting teachers \r\nhave to be very conscientious, thorough, and straightforward \r\nin their reports and recommendations. They \r\nhave to be objective. They can\'t duck difficult decisions. \r\nSo those are the kinds of things we looked for. \r\nThere were seventy-five applicants, and we chose \r\nfifteen people to go into a pool from which we draw to \r\nmatch as closely as possible the subject and grade level \r\nr I ofboth the interns and those teachers identified for the \r\nI intervention program. The teachers selected went\r\n\r\nL J \r\n\r\nthrough intensive training, and we have continual inr \r\n1 service, consultation, and feedback. Currently, out of \r\nr tht fifteen consulting teachers in the pool, seven of \r\nl J them are working full time in the program. \r\n\r\nQuestion: Are they paid extra? \r\nLawrence: They\'re paid Sl ,250 extra, plus they\'re paid \r\nfor any supplementary contracts they might have held \r\neven though they are not doing the supplementary \r\nduty. This isn\'t enough but it is some reCOgnition. As the \r\n\r\nrÂ· progr.un is now set up, consulting teachers can only \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nserve in that role for three years; then they return to the \r\ndassroom. \r\nQuestion: Lets concentrate first on the internship \r\npart of the program Can you gil1e us a sense of the \r\n\r\nl relationship between the consulting teacher and the\r\n\r\nJ \r\n\r\nintern? \r\n\r\nLawrence: A consulting teacher is a mentor to the new \r\nteacher. He or she is responsible for the professional \r\ndevelopment of the intern. It is a very personal and \r\nsupportive approach, and it gives the new teacher a \r\nmuch better chance of succeeding. \r\n\r\nA consulting teacher is assigned from seven to ten \r\ninterns. If he or she is working with one or two teachers \r\nin the intervention program, there will be fewer interns \r\n\r\n[ : \r\n\r\n! \r\nassigned ~ccausewe find that the intervention program \r\nl takes a considerable amount oftime. A consulting teach\r\n\r\n\r\nJ \r\n\r\ner will spend, on the average, half a day each week with \r\neach intern. H someone\'s having difficulty, he will receive \r\nmore attention. . \r\n\r\nL.J \r\nWe\'ve found that the areas in which the interns need \r\n\r\n24 I AMf.RJCAN EDUCATOR \r\n\r\n~Under the traditional system, \r\nthere was little or no attention \r\ngiven to the professional \r\ndevelopment ofthe new \r\nteacher.\' \r\n\r\n\\ \r\n\'~, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe most help are classroom management and teaching \r\ntechnique. A considerable amount of time is spent in \r\nclassroom observation, followed by extensive discussion \r\nof what worked well and what didn\'t. A seasoned \r\nteacher has probably experienced many of the \r\nsame problems at some point in his own teaching and \r\ncan spot the weak areas and offer alternative techniques. \r\nOften, interns are given the opportunity to observe \r\nother successful teachers in the field. Some consulting \r\nteachers videotape the intern and then they \r\nreview the teaching process together. Teachers typically \r\nget very little feedback on their own teaching, so this \r\nis very useful. \r\n\r\nSome interns need help with their questioning technique, \r\nothers with organizing lesson plans, preparing \r\nIEPs, getting ready for a parent-teacher conference, \r\nfinding out what resources are available, interpreting \r\nthe results of standardized tests, and so on. \r\n\r\nAlso, new teachers are often overwhelmed by the \r\nbureaucracy, the system, the paperwork. The consulting \r\nteacher knows the system and can show the intern \r\nhow to make things happen. What are the procedures \r\nfor dealing with extreme diScipline problems that can\'t \r\nbe adequately handled in the classroom? What do I do \r\nwhen I\'m out of supplies and the office says there\'s no \r\nmoney? When can I use the mimeograph machine? \r\nWhat if the janitor isn\'t cleaning the blackboards? The \r\nlist is endless. . \r\n\r\nSPRING 1984. \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\n\r\nn________--____ â€¢ \r\n\r\n;.Uld I\'d like you to look at it.\'! I looked at it an it said \r\n\r\nfl \\ J \r\nfl , :I \r\nrJ \r\nAnd sometimes it\'s just the idea of having someone \r\nthere to reaJnrm what they\'re doing, to tell them they \r\narc on the right track. \r\n\r\nSome of the process is very formal. for example, the \r\nconsulting teacher and the intern jointly establish \r\nobjectives. These are always put into writing. We want \r\nto make certain the interns know exactly what they \r\nneed to be working on to improve their performance. \r\nThen, twice a ycar, they\'re evaluated based on how well \r\nthey arc meeting those objectives. \r\nQuestion: How does this newprogram compare with \r\nthe old system? Were new teachers pretty much in a \r\nsinkÂ·orÂ·swim situation? \r\n\r\nLawrence: Yes, always. A new teacher dosed that door \r\nand, for the most part, was on her own. It was not \r\nuncommon, for example, for a teacher to begin the year \r\nwithout books. I had a teacher this fall who called the \r\noffice and said she didn\'t have chairs or desks, but she \r\ndid have kids. Under the traditional system, the princiÂ· \r\npal would come in to observe and evaluate; there was \r\nlittle or no attention given to the profeSSional dcvelopÂ· \r\nment of the new teacher. If the principal got in three \r\ntimes during a semester, that was about the maximum. \r\nThere were instances where they didn\'t show up af all. \r\nWhen I started teaching, I didn\'t have the principal \r\ncome into my classroom at all my first year. I was called \r\ndown to the office toward the end of the second semester \r\nand the principal said, \"I have your evaluation here \r\n\r\nSPRJNG 1984 \r\n\r\nfl \r\n\r\nJ \r\n\r\n1 0\r\n\r\nr .. \r\n\r\nr\' \r\n\r\nl ) \r\nr \' \r\n\r\ni \r\n\r\n~ j \r\n\r\nr . \r\nI \r\n\r\nl ] \r\n\r\nl. j \r\n\"satisfactory.\" In fact, there wasn\'t anythin~ in it that I \r\nwould object to. I said, \"How do you know I\'m \r\nsatisfactory?\" And he said, \"Oh, ah, ah, the kids let me \r\nknow. I knew I didn\'t have to spend any time with you. \r\nYou\'re doing a good job.\" I said, \"Oh, thank you,\" and I \r\nleft. The point is I might have been having all kinds of \r\ntrouble and the same thing would have happened. He \r\nwould have probably found it out from the kids. He \r\ncertainly wouldn\'t have had enough time to help me. It \r\nwas sink or swim. I was one ofthe luck\\\' ones who didn\'t \r\n\r\nsink. . . \r\nQuestion: One ofthe major problems with tbe trattiÂ· \r\ntional system is that the principal or assistant prine;Â· \r\n.pal does not have suffiCient knowledge ofthe mriollS \r\nsubject matters, grade levels, and specialization areas \r\n-the old story of the ex-biOlogy teacher tlJling to \r\nadequately evaluate, not to mention help, a Fretlch \r\nteacher, a math teacher, ora special education teclcher. \r\nThis program changes that. \r\n\r\nLawrence: Yes, that\'s one of the major advantages 0# \r\nour approach. With a pool of consulting teachers to \r\ndraw from, we have a great deal of ability to put a \r\nscience teacher with a science teacher, an art teacher \r\nwith an art teacher, an elementary te\'ldll.\'r with an \r\nelementary teacher. That mat<:h makl.\'s a critical diJference \r\nin both the quality ofassistan<.\'e that can be offered \r\na new teacher and in the reliability of the evaluation. \r\nQuestion: Allotberperelillial lensiollin teacher evaluatioll \r\nis tbat there is no finn consensus on what \r\nwllstitutes the proper standard ofpractice in a gillen \r\nteaching area. We may all be able to agree that certain \r\nI\'nethods are inappropriate, but we might n()t agree on \r\nwhat is the best or the right approach in the classroom \r\nG\'iven this lack ofconsensus, do tbe consulting teacher \r\nand the Review Panel make allowancesfor legitimate \r\ndifferences in teaching s~J\'le? \r\n\r\nLawrence: Yes, they do. We don\'t try to tell an intern \r\nwhat is the best technique. The consulting teachers \r\nknow that their goal is not to make copies ofthemscives. \r\nWe present the kinds of things that work in different \r\nsituations. We do that by taking into consideration the \r\ninterns\' own abilitil.\'S and interests, what they are doing \r\nbest and what works for them. We are not, and we reall\" \r\nstress this to the consulting teachers, here to tell an \r\nintern that this is the way you do it. We\'re here to \r\npresent alternatives, to identify strengths and we<lkn(.\"Â§,ses, \r\nand to help them achieve proficiency in those techniques \r\nthat really do work. There are some things. as \r\nyou say, that we know won\'t work. You always see them \r\nin beginners, and they are very easily corrected. But so \r\nfar as presenting a particular lesson, there is no magic, \r\n\"right\" way. We don\'t pretend there is, and we don\'t \r\nforce people into a predetermined mold. \r\nQuestion: At the end of the illtemship, the Relliew \r\nPanel votes on whether to recommend the in tern for a \r\nsecond year of teaching, is that right? \r\n\r\nLawrence: Yes. We would have been receiving \r\nperiodic reports from the conSUlting teachers throughout \r\nthe year, all of which are gone over with careful \r\nscrutiny by the RevieW Panel. The consulting teachers \r\nhave to justify what they are doing. We pepper them \r\nwith questions, and there is a lot of back-and-forth discussion. \r\nWe know that the intern isn\'t going to be \r\n\r\nAMERJCAN EDUCATOR / 25 \r\n\r\nl. ~ \r\n\r\nn \r\nn \r\nperfe.\'e.Â·t at the e.Â·nd of the year.

You do a g()od job at that, then take \r\nanother\'one. You do a good joh at that. This phase might \r\nlast several months depending on the individual and \r\nhow longstanding the bad habits are. And then, the good \r\npart is when the person finally begins to succeed with \r\nsome new technique, some new approach. You can see \r\nhim begin to smile for the first time, maybe, in ten years. \r\nYou can see him saying to himself: \"Gee, that does work, \r\nand I can do that.\" Self-confidence, missing for so long, \r\nbegins to return. And the kids begin to respond in \r\ndifferent ways to the teacher. At that stage. the. rapport \r\nbetween the consulting teacher and the person in trouble \r\nis usually very solid. A very close professional bond \r\ndevelops . \r\n\r\nI should add that there is no limit to the duration of \r\nthe intervention process. There is no hastiness. We have \r\nsome interventions that are in their second year. \r\nQuestion: To date, what have been the outcomes of \r\nthe interoention program? \r\n\r\nLawrence: We have had twenty-four people identified \r\nfor intervention. Four of those are now out of the pro-\\ \r\ngram, doing acceptabl~ work.on their own again. We \r\nwere successful in obtaining disahility retirement for a \r\ncouple of people. Another individual wanted to lea\\\'C \r\nthe teaching division and move into the nonteaching \r\ndivision. We arranged that transfer. and that person is \r\nmuch happier than he was in the classroom. One per. \r\nson, who was on a one-year contract, was terminated. \r\nFifteen teachers are still in the program. \r\nQuestion: At the end ofthe intervention process, does \r\nthe Review Panel make any recommendation conÂ· \r\ncerning the status of the teacher who has been in the \r\nprogram? \r\n\r\nLawrence: No, and neither does the consulting teachÂ· \r\ner. This is very different from the procedure followed in \r\nthe intern program in which the Review Panel makes a \r\nformal recommendation. In the intervention program, \r\nthe union\'s involvement is almost exclusively in terms \r\nof participating in the decision to place the teacher in \r\nthe program. Unlike the intern program, the! Review \r\nPanel does not playa part in the Status reports or get \r\ninvolved in other details. When the consulting teacher \r\ndetermines that the intervention process is completed, \r\nhe prepares a report detailing the work that has taken \r\nplace. If the administration, at that point or any point, \r\ndecides to initiate termination proceedings against the \r\nteacher, and ifthat teacher requests representation, the \r\nunion treats the situation like it would any other grievance. \r\nWe would not be in the position ofhaving put our \r\nimprimatur on the status reports. So if there\'s a good \r\ncase to be made, we would he able to arbitrate the \r\ndismissal. \r\nQuestion: But the union is intimately involved in the \r\ndecision to place the teacher in interoention, whicb \r\nmeans, as you\'ve said, identifying that teacher as \r\nsomeone who is having serious prOblems. And as I \r\nunderstand it, once the decision is made, the teacher \r\nhas no choice but to en fer the program orface possible \r\ncharges ofinsubordination. As you knou~ the union\'s \r\ninvolvement in this kind Of peer review is a controversial \r\nidea. In the intern program, the Review Panel with \r\nthe union in the majority -actually makes a \r\nrecommendation as to whether a first-year teacher \r\nwill be renewed And in the inten.\'ention part, the \r\n\r\nAMERI(\'.AN EDll(\".ATOR / 27 \r\n\r\nL.

We went into it with our eyes open \r\n\r\nknowing that there were going to be things that had to \r\n\r\nbe changed as we learned and worked our way through \r\n\r\nsome of these problems. Weare not presenting any of \r\n\r\nthis as the best that can happen, but we are learning as \r\n\r\nwe go, taking it one step at a time. \r\n\r\nYou first have to recognize that being identified for \r\n\r\nintervention is not synonymous with having your job \r\n\r\nplaced in jeopardy. Our goal, our first responsibility, is \r\n\r\nto improve the performance of that person so that the \r\n\r\nindividual is not in jeopardy, so that his or her job is not \r\n\r\nin jeopardy. Without doubt. we are saving the cru-eers of \r\n\r\nsome teachers, because if their performance continued \r\n\r\nto deteriorate and discharge proceedings were brought \r\n\r\nby management, we could lose a lot of those cases if \r\n\r\nthey went to arbitration. \r\n\r\nWe are doing everything we can to see that there are . \r\nsafeguards against hasty or unfair treatment. For example, \r\nlet\'s say a principal wants to place a teacher in \r\nthe program. If the union committee does not think \r\nthat\'s an appropriate program for that teacher, it can \r\nveto the principal\'s recommendation. And it has been \r\nOlJr practice that before a decision is made to place a \r\ntcacher in intervention, there must be a unanimous, \r\nconfidential vote of the union building committee at \r\nthat teacher\'s school. That committee of teachers is \r\nelected ~nually by the other teachers in the school, so \r\nit is very cautious about going out on a limb. It knows it \r\nhas to maintain the confidence and the trust of that \r\nteaching staff. In addition, before the building committee \r\nis empowered to even consider the case, there is a \r\nreview of the situation at the level of my office. Finally, \r\nto afford as much due-process protection to the teacher \r\nas possible, we are now looking into the establishment \r\nof an appeal process through an independent, neutral \r\nthird party. As we envision it, any teacher who feels he \r\nor she was erroneously or unfairly identified for intervention \r\ncould have a review by this third party to \r\ndetermine if the identification was warranted. \r\n\r\nI don\'t have all the answers, but if there are further \r\npoints of conflict or tension that we haven\'t yet faced, \r\nwe are determined to work them out so that we can \r\nkeep teachers rather than administrators in charge of \r\nsetting standards for the profession. I don\'t see any \r\nunresolvable conflict between this program and the \r\nresponsibility of the union to protect people against \r\nunfair treatment or unfair dismissals .. \r\nQuestion: I knowfrom looking atyour contract that \r\nthe Toledo Federation ofTeachers has been quite successful \r\nin its attempts to\' put teachers in charge Of \r\nprofessional decisions.

Doyou see this newprogram as one more step \r\nin that direction? \r\n\r\nLawrence: Yes, that\'s our goal. 1ne first thing we did in \r\nthis school district, in our first contract, was to do \r\neverything possible to get control of inservice training. \r\nWe\'ve been building from that point ever since. We\'ve \r\nused the bargaining process to build a real profession \r\nand to establish those conditions that make quality \r\nteaching possible: smaller class size, preparation time, \r\ntraining and assistance, salaries that will attract good \r\npeople. and so forth. The key factor in building a quality \r\nsystem is to place profeSSional decisions in the hands of \r\nthe teachers themselves. Historically, every profession \r\nhas exercised control over who is deemed acceptable \r\nto enter its ranks. \r\n\r\n\'Through our involvement in this program, teachers \r\nstand now more than ever at the center of the profesÂ· \r\nsional endeavor. We are involving large numbers of \r\nteachers -the consulting teachers, the interns, the \r\nteachers experiencing serious difficulties, the union \r\nbuilding committees -in examining, refining, and \r\noverseeing the standards of teaching practiCe. I think \r\nthat\'s an important role for the union to play. \r\n\r\nWe would like to place other professional decisions \r\nin the hands ofteachers. I want to get away from the idea \r\nthat the teacher is a hired hand who shows up and \r\nthere\'s the class ofkids -someone else has made all the \r\ndeciSions, and sometimes made them badly, without \r\nadequate information. That\'s not acceptable for two \r\nrea~)flS: First, the educational output has not been \r\nsatisfactory under these conditions, and secondly, no \r\none can behave like a responsible professional unless he \r\nis given responsibility. I would i\'~;:e teachers everyÂ· \r\nwhere to draft the class lists like we do in Toledo. I \r\nwould like to see placement determination decisions \r\nmade bv teachers. I would like to see teachers take the \r\nlead in the discussion of what can be done next year at \r\ntheir schools to improve the instructional program as a \r\nresult of what they learned this year. We can only \r\naccomplish these things through collective bargaining: \r\nThat\'s our tool. Nothing is going to be handed to us on a \r\nsilver platter. \r\nQuestion: What has been the reaction ofthe publiC to \r\nthis program? \r\n\r\nLawrence~ Very positive. The parents are enthusiastic. \r\n\'Ihey are curious. They like it. The press has been enthuÂ· \r\nsiastic. The teachers themselves are taking pride in the \r\nprogram. There\'s no doubt that this is contributing to \r\nheightened public confidence in the schools. Toledo, \r\nlike many other urban school systems around the counÂ· \r\n\r\n. try, had its share ofproblems during the 70s: a declining \r\nindustrial base, a serious recession, a shortage of funds, \r\ntwo school closings. Morale was very low. We were \r\nforced to go on strike in 1970 and 1978. \r\nNow the system is on its way back to sound health. \r\nWe even passed a large operating levy recently. It\'s a \r\nconstant uphill battle. You absolutely must have a pubÂ· \r\nlie school system that works and one that parents perÂ· \r\n\r\nSPRING 1984 \r\n\r\nkids in private schools. \'111en you add the idea of tuition \r\n\r\ntax credits, which is nothing less than paying people to \r\n\r\nleave the public school system, and we can sec how \r\n\r\nimportant it is to convince the public of the excellence \r\n\r\nofour schools. I think our program can havt\' a dmmatic \r\n\r\nimpact on public opinioJl. Certainly the public is going \r\n\r\nto be listening and appreciative if the teaching profesÂ· \r\n\r\nsion itself makes it clear that we take seriously the \r\n\r\nrcsponsibility for high standards for new teachers and \r\n\r\nfor improving the performance of those teach~rs with \r\n\r\nserious problems. \r\n\r\nQuestion: As YOIl knou\\ a number (~f otber scbool \r\n\r\ndistricts and AFT local ullions around the country \r\n\r\nhalle expressed interest in tbe Toledo Plan. What \r\n\r\nadvicedoyou haL1efor those wllo mightbe considering \r\n\r\nthe establishment ofsomething similar in their areas? \r\n\r\nWhat conditions are necessary to make such a proÂ· \r\n\r\ngram successfu.l? \r\n\r\n\r\nLawrence: First -I guess this goes without saying -\r\nthere must be widespread support from the memÂ·\\ \r\nbcrship. We first posed the idea of an intern program to \r\nour members in 1973, and the response was 5 to 1 in \r\n\r\nfavor. \r\n\r\nSecond, the union must be very strong. It must have \r\n\r\nthe trust and contldence of its members. It must have a \r\n\r\nsolid contract that tlrmly protects the rights of teachers. \r\n\r\nIt must be effectivt\' at the school level, with an active \r\n\r\nunion committee at e\\\'ery school site. And. of course, \r\n\r\nthis program cannot exist in the middle ofa jurisdictionÂ· \r\n\r\nal dispute with the NEA. 1he tcaching force must be \r\n\r\nunified. \r\n\r\nAs for the administration, they have to be willing to \r\n\r\nadmit that the traditional system hasn\'t been working \r\n\r\nwell. They have to be willing to change the existing \r\n\r\nrelationships, to give up some of their power, to give \r\n\r\nteachers more responsibility. They have to re-think \r\n\r\ntheir attitudes toward evaluation and agree that evaluaÂ· \r\n\r\ntion must be tied to a strong professional dcvclopm(.\'nt \r\n\r\nsystem. \r\n\r\nI should also caution people to make sure they are \r\nprotected against any YeshivaÂ·type legal decisions. ColÂ· \r\nlective bargaining laws should be reviewed to ensure \r\nthat consulting teachers will not be excluded from the \r\nbargaining unit and that the assumption of these new \r\nresponsibilities will not in any way jcopardize the \r\nunion\'s status as collective bargaining agent. \r\nQuestion: One last question: The union\'s emphasis in \r\nthese two-new programs is on excellence in the teachÂ· \r\ning profession. What abou.t excellence among princiÂ· \r\npals? ShOUldn\'t there be a similarprogram for them? \r\n\r\nLawrence: Absolutely. As a matter of fact, this school \r\n\r\ndistrict is now very close to putting in place an intervenÂ· \r\n\r\ntion program for school principals. Principals are not \r\n\r\nappOinted by God as perfect and forever will remain \r\n\r\nperfect. They have to learn their role, and they need \r\n\r\nhelp and support in doing what they do the same as \r\n\r\nteachers need help and support. Some of them need to \r\n\r\nbe taken out of the school business. The way we have \r\n\r\ngone about appointing and policing the managers ofour \r\n\r\nschools doesn\'t make any sense. Everybody can agree \r\n\r\nthat we need good, competent principals, supervisory \r\n\r\npersonnel, and curriculum people. But we have to rede\r\n\r\n\r\nfine the parameters of those jobs_ \r\n\r\nAMERICAN EDUCATOR I 29 \r\n\r\n\r\nrl ;r \r\n\r\n\"\', and an enthusiastic supporter or the proÂ· n ., sram, -\' \r\n\\ J Berore 1981, Toledo tcachers were \r\n\r\nevaluated by building princip31~, But traÂ· \r\nditional methods of te3ch~r e\'.\'aluatil\\n \r\nlrl . had proved ineffective and buruensoml.\', \r\n:J and ballles betwe~n labor :lnd manage, \r\nment flared up over botched or incomplete \r\n\'e~\'aluations, As a result, the top adminisÂ· \r\ntrators in Jthe district began to look serio \r\n\r\n\r\nl \r\n\r\nlJ \r\n\r\nously at in\'volving the union in the training \r\nand proressional development of staff \r\nmembers, (The ractthatthe TFT was both\r\n\r\nrl \r\n\r\nI \' strong and respected played no small pari l j in management\'s decision to review the \r\n\'situation,) \r\n\r\nThe s),stem of evaluation used by the \r\n-rJ Toledo principals stressed many of the \r\n\\ j same skills that arc now emphasized by \r\nteacher \"consultants, n Bllt principals rareÂ· \r\nr l Iy had adequate time for evaluatiq: and \r\n\r\nI ! \r\n\r\nassisting new teachers, and too often all\r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\nbut the poorest teachers were roulinel)\' \r\n\" recommended for continuing contracts. \r\n-\';.:; (Only one new teacher was terminated in\r\n\r\nr-1 \r\n\r\nthe five years immediately preceding the \r\n\r\nl \r\n\r\nS1art of the new program.) \r\n\r\nMoreover, due process procedures \r\nwere often ignored, and the number of inÂ· \r\ndividuals doing the evaluating -some iO \r\nprincipals -made uniformity impossible \r\n\r\n: \'.:. to a.chievc.

Nearly 60 percent of the \r\nteachers responding to the poll endorsed \r\nthe creation of a national certification \r\nboard for teachers. Also, 91.8 \r\npercent agreed or strongly agreed with \r\nthe career-ladder concept, which would \r\nallow them to advance without having \r\nto enter administration and leave \r\nteaching. \r\n\r\nWhen asked to rank possible criteria \r\nfor advancement on a career ladder, \r\n\"assessment of teaching skills\" was \r\nhighest, with years of experience, advanced \r\neducation and level of certification \r\nreceiving some support. \r\n\r\nSome 83.1 percent agreed that \"standards \r\nand criteria for effective teaching \r\nshould be determined by the teaching \r\nprofession rather than by professional \r\n\r\nadministrators. \" \r\n\r\nThe teachers also supported the expansion \r\nof peer evaluation and the involvement \r\nof teachers in performance \r\nreview of their principals. Respondents \r\nto the survey \"feel teachers should \r\nhave a greater role in educational deqisions \r\nand they support reforms in \r\nteacher training and certification,\" read \r\na statement by poll researchers. \r\n\r\nTeachers also clearly believe that \r\nreducing class size is the most important \r\nstep in efforts to improve student \r\nachievement and increase teacher \r\neffectiveness. \r\n\r\nOver 40 percent of Cincinnati \r\nteachers said they have ~onsidered \r\nleaving the school district or the \r\nteaching profession during the past two \r\nyears. \r\n\r\n\"I was~IIi)iI_\"_-\".~ \r\nt ers considered leaving,\" \r\neported Mooney. \"Changes need to b \r\nmade.\" \r\nOne-third of the district\'s 3,200 \r\nteachers completed the IS6-question \r\nsurvey. \r\n\r\nAdminisfnltcrs \r\nLawsuit Dismissed \r\n\r\nRuling that the district\'s mentor \r\nteacher program does not harmfully \r\naffect school administrators, a New \r\nYork state judge h~ dismissed an administrator\'s \r\nlawsuit against the \r\nRochester Teachers Association and the \r\ncity\'s school district. \r\n\r\nThe president of the Association of \r\nSupervisors and Administrators of \r\nRochester sued last year, claiming that \r\nthe district\'s Peer Assistance Review \r\n(PAR) program impinged upon administrators\' \r\nresponsibilities and that \r\nteachers were not certified to participate \r\nin teacher evaluations.

The Toledo \r\nPlan is an effective teacher performance \r\ntool based on peer coaching and evaluation. \r\nBoldly different from traditional \r\nevaluation procedures in use by other \r\nschool systems, intern-intervention has \r\ngenerated considerable national and international \r\nattention for Toledo. This \r\nrecognition has resulted in over 3000 \r\nrequests for information from school systems \r\nand others interested in peer review \r\nand higher classroom performance \r\nstandards. \r\n\r\nThis pacesetting program, which was \r\nstarted in 1981, provides a formula for \r\nprofessional development ofbeginning \r\nteachers and an evaluation system that \r\ndetects and screens out those who show \r\nlittle aptitude for the classroom. Additionally, \r\nexperienced teachers who are severely \r\ndeficient in performance are given \r\nintensive peer assistance to bring their \r\nwork to acceptable standards. This intensive \r\nsystem of evaluation is aimed at \r\nthose most in need of professional help \r\n-beginners in our system and those experienced \r\nteachers in trouble. For these \r\nindividuals, intern-intervention delivers \r\nthe very finest professional help avail:able \r\n-peers who are themselves excellent \r\nteachers. \r\n\r\n~:;I;jdi~~h\"~~d~:r~m . \r\n\r\n\r\nAU teachers newly hired by Toledo Publie \r\nSchools are subject to inclusion in the \r\nIntern Program. Each new teacher\'s status \r\nis determined by the co-chairs of the \r\nIntern Board of Review. Those designated \r\nas interns are assigned a consulting \r\nteacher (mentor teacher) for the purpose \r\nof professional development and evaluation. \r\nThe Intern Program allows the consulting \r\nteacher the time to conduct a complete \r\nevaluation of the intern\'s progress \r\nand ultimate success (or lack thereof) in \r\nmeeting the performance standards of the \r\nToledo Public Schools. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation process is one of continuous \r\nmutual goal-setting using classroom \r\nobservations and follow-up conferences \r\nwhere the intern and consultant can analyze \r\nand set practical goals for improvement \r\nbased on detailed evaluation criteria. \r\nA consultant may use any of anumber \r\nof methods to assist the intern in meeting \r\nthe goals set such as demonstration \r\nlessons, video taping, observations of other \r\nteachers. \r\n\r\nThe consulting teacher assigned to each \r\n\r\nintern will have final responsibility for the \r\n\r\nevaluation of the intern. Evaluation re\r\n\r\n\r\nports are filed by each consulting teacher \r\n\r\non or before December 20 and March 20. \r\n\r\nEvaluations are based largely on the \r\n\r\nintern\'s progress toward meeting specific \r\n\r\ngoals as determined by the consulting \r\n\r\nteacher. At the last evaluation date, the \r\n\r\nintern consulting teacher recommends to \r\n\r\nthe Intern Board of Review the future \r\n\r\nemployment status of the intern teacher. \r\n\r\nThis board. accepts or rejects the recom\r\n\r\n\r\nmendation of the consulting teacher. The \r\n\r\nnine member board is composed of five \r\n\r\nteachers and four administrators.

The autonomy \r\nthat teachers have within their classrooms is considerably \r\ncompromised by their exclusion from decisions on \r\nissues that affect life in the classroom, such as school \r\nstructure and organization, disciplinary procedures, \r\ncurriculum content, academic standards, staffing needs \r\nand hiring decisions, and spending priorities. Teachers \r\nsometimes sit on committees that consider these issues, \r\nbut there usually is a clear distinction between \"input\" \r\nand decision making, with teachers on the input side. \r\nAlthough collective bargaining contracts touch on \r\nsome issues of educational policy, school boards -\r\nbacked by courts and state legislatures -have generally \r\ntried to narrow the scope of bargaining, insisting that \r\ntopics other than wages and working conditions are \r\nmanagement prerogatives and, as~ such, \"not negotiable.\" \r\nIn Hammond, Indiana, all of this is changing. To the \r\nextent that it is legally and practically possible to do so, \r\ndecisions that were once made by the school district\'s \r\ncentral office are being turned over to each individual \r\nschool. Not only has the locus of authority changed, so \r\nhas the constellation of who holds it. A growing number \r\nof decisions are now in the hands of school-site committees \r\ncomposed of teachers, administrators, and community \r\nrepresentatives. The boundaries of teacher allowed to be a separate culture -and in theories of \r\nauthority have been dramatically expanded. For the first modern management that emphasize the importance of \r\ntime, teachers are touching all the areas that touch them decentralization, employee involvement in the deciand \r\ntheir students. sions that affect their work, and the development of a \r\nHammond\'s new school-site management system is feeling of \"ownership\" of those decisions. \r\nthe result of a program called the School Improvement The city of Hammond has a population of about one \r\nProcess, more commonly referred to as SIP.

The economic depression that \r\n\r\nhas hit the citys industrial base -the steel mills -and \r\n\r\nthat has left the school district in a constant struggle \r\n\r\nagainst financial constraints seems to stand in sharp \r\n\r\ncontrast to the hope and enthusiasm generated by the \r\n\r\nSIP program. \r\n\r\nIn 1985, following a successful pilot project at one \r\n\r\nhigh school and two middle schools, language outlining \r\n\r\nthe authority and procedures for the School Improve\r\n\r\n\r\nment Process were negotiated and made part of the \r\n\r\ncontract between the Hammond Teachers Federation \r\n\r\nand the Board of School Trustees. SIP was then \r\n\r\nexpanded to all schools in the district. The president of \r\n\r\nthe Hammond Teachers Federation -and by everyone\'s \r\n\r\naccount the source of much of the energy and inspira\r\n\r\n\r\ntion behind SIP -is Patrick O\'Rourke. Mr. \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke has been president of the teachers union \r\n\r\nsince 1974, during which time he has continued to \r\n\r\nteach U.S. history part time at Hammond High School. \r\n\r\nHe is a member of the Executive Board of the Indiana \r\n\r\nFederation of Teachers and part-time instructor in labor \r\n\r\nrelations at Indiana University Northwest. \r\n\r\nMr. O\'Rourke was interviewed by Uz McPike, editor \r\n\r\nof the American Educator. \r\n\r\n* * * \r\n\r\nMcPike: So that we can immediately get some grasp \r\nofthe dimensions ofwhat is happening in Hammond, \r\ntell me this: Is there anything that is \"off limits\" to \r\nthese school-site committees? How encompassing is \r\ntheir authority, or their potential authority? Is there \r\nany issue, any toPic, any area ofdecision making that \r\nis hands Off? \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: We\'re not sure. The only constraints that \r\n\r\nwe know for certain are the same constraints that the \r\n,.old system had, that is, limitations -often of a legal \r\n. nature -that stem from Supreme Court deCisions, state \r\n\r\nand federal laws, school board poliCies, city regulations, \' \r\n\r\nand to some extent, our union contract. But other than \r\n\r\nthose constraints, it\'s wide open. As long as a school \r\n\r\nadheres to the process we\'ve developed, the people at \r\n\r\nthat school and in that community have a great deal of \r\n\r\ncontrol over what happens in their school. \r\n\r\nIn those instances in which a school-based decision \r\n\r\nconflicts with an existing school board policy, a special \r\n\r\nsystemwide review council, composed of teachers, \r\n\r\nadministrators, parents and community representatives, \r\n\r\nmeets to see how the SIP proposal could be accommo\r\n\r\n\r\ndated. And even in those situations in which a SIP pro\r\n\r\n\r\nposal clearly violates state policy, ifthe SIP committee is \r\n\r\nvery interested in pursuing an idea and convinced that it \r\n\r\nwill improve learning at their school, and if they\'re able \r\n\r\nto muster a good argument to support their case, then \r\n\r\nthe school district has said it will attempt to secure a \r\n\r\nwaiver from the state. \r\n\r\nA few of us tried in the beginning, when we were \r\n\r\nbrainstorming this whole thing, to assign all possible \r\n\r\ndeciSions to their appropriate level. Which decisions \r\n\r\ncould be made at the building level, which had to be \r\n\r\ncitywide, and so forth. Heres what we did. This sounds \r\n\r\nhilarious in retrospect, but we were feeling our way \r\n\r\nthrough many of these questions, and it was a helpful \r\n\r\nexercise. We actually built a st~ucture, a box, and \r\n\r\n12 AMERICAN EDUCATOR \r\n\r\n\r\nRather than the old model ofafew \r\npeople, a handful ofadministrators \r\nprimarily, Sitting around trying to \r\ndevelop policy, we open it up. \r\n\r\ndivided it into different sections. Then we took some \r\nsmall plastic balls, and we colored them various colors; \r\nwe coded them. For example, the color red would \r\nsignify a school board decision, blue would be a building-\r\nbased deciSion, and so on. We sat and brainstortl).ed \r\nall the types of decisions that might arise in a school \r\ndistrict: \"Well, that\'s obviously a red ball, that goes in this \r\nslot. That\'s the kind of issue that you could characterize \r\nas a building-based deciSion, we\'ll color that blue, and \r\nall the blue balls go in this slot,\" and so on with Supreme \r\nCourt decisions, state directives, etc. We sat there and \r\ntossed spheres into the box for several hours. \r\n\r\nMcPike: You literally had a lot ofballs in the air. \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: Yes, too many, as it turned out. As we tried \r\nto visualize how we were going to delineate the proper \r\nboundaries of authority -where does this fit, where \r\ndoes that belong, what were the various impediments, \r\nthe potential conflicts -it occurred to us that the \r\nnumber of decisions was unlimited; we were going to \r\nrun out of balls. \r\n\r\nSo we learned through this process that it is not \r\npossible -or necessary -to divide up the turf ahead of \r\ntime. In other words, the program does not say, \"These \r\ndecisions are proper for building-based committees, \r\nthese are not\"; it does not say, \"These programs may be \r\naltered, but these may not.\" These divisions will have to \r\nemerge as the program moves along. There are no preconceived \r\nlimits. \r\n\r\nThere is only one exception to this: We have said that \r\nno decision made by one school could have a negative \r\nimpact on programs or teachers in other buildings. \r\n\r\nMcPike: School A couldn\'t decide to send all its \r\ndisruptive students to School B? \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: Exactly, although that very constraint \r\nmight serve as a spark to bring SIP committees from \r\nvarious schools together to try to work something out. \r\nThere have alreadv been instances in which a recommendation \r\nmade by one school has forced the district to \r\nreÂ·examine its overall policy. We have a SIP team right \r\nnow at Clark High School working on the problem of \r\nstudent attendance. They have developed a very sophisticated \r\nattendance policy that goes beyond the current \r\ncitywide policy. But we have been advised that this new \r\nproposal may be in violation of court decisions because \r\nit would mean that students at one high school would be \r\ntreated differently from the rest of the city\'s students on \r\na matter that might affect their grades and even their \r\ncontinuation in the program in thebuUding.

Their ideas are being \r\n\r\n. ewed as perhaps the resolution ofa citywide problem. \r\nVI SO there will be instances in which a SIP team will \r\nbrai~storm the resolution of a problem at one school \r\nthat may eventuallywind up having very positive effects \r\non cityWide policy. That\'s part of the spin-off that \r\nintrigues me. As SIP teams hit roadblocks, they have to \r\nstart looking at other problems in other buildings or \r\nperhaps look citywide. They start thinking in broader \r\nterms than their own classrooms or their own schools. \r\nSo rather than the old model ofa few people, a handful \r\nof \' administrators primarily, sitting around trying to \r\ndevelop policy, we open it up. We now have more peo-, \r\nple,let\'s say more brains, more ideas, floating around out \r\nthere, and out of these ideas, we are developing some \r\nvery sophisticated approaches to citywide problems, \r\nwhich was really not, quite frankly, the original intent of \r\nthe school-based decision-making process. But that is \r\nhappening, and it\'s very exciting. \r\n\r\nMcPike: We haven\'t said anything about money. \r\nHow much say-so over spending comes under the SIP \r\ncommittees? \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: Each school receives a certain amount of \r\nmoney over which it has control. Should a SIP committee \r\nwant to get involved in how that money is spent rather \r\nthan leaving it as a unilateral decision by a building \r\nadministrator, which is the way things previously \r\nworked -it can. \r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, last year -and I view this as a \r\nmistake -last year in an attempt to convince building \r\nadministrators that the school system was serious about \r\nthis process, the responsibility for the allocation of \r\nfunds normally given to the building administrator was \r\nturned over by directive from the assistant superintendent \r\nof schools to the SIP team in each building. The \r\nreason I say that was a mistake is that it violated the spirit \r\nand the intent of the process in the sense that the \r\nadministration is not supposed to set the agenda for SIP \r\ncommittees. The directive was issued with the very best \r\nof motives -to show that SIP committees have power \r\nover the purse strings -but the decision as to what a \r\nSIP committee wants to get into and what it doesn\'t \r\nshould really be left up to each committee. Ifit wants to \r\ndecide how the money allocated to its school should be \r\nspent, it certainly can. Now don\'t misunderstand me. \r\nSIP teams do not control the school district\'s overall \r\nbudget. They only have control -if they choose to \r\nexercise it -over those monies that are allocated to \r\ntheir particular building. \r\n\r\nMcPike: Describe for us in more detail how SIP \r\noperates. Is thereoneSIP committeeateach school that \r\ndefines the issues to be taken up and subcommittees \r\nthat form around those issues? Does an administrator \r\n~the principal or assistant principal or someone -\r\nSIt in on every committee meeting? And how arefinal \r\ndeciSions made? \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: The teams are made up of teachers, \r\nadministrators, parents, and to a lesser degree, students, \r\nalthough there might not be peoplefrom every category \r\n\r\no.n every committee, or what we call design teams. The \r\nsIZe of the committees varies. In a large high school o( \r\nlets say, one hundred teachers, the core team is usually \r\nSPRING 1987 \r\n\r\nrules, other than that we try to involve people on the \r\n\r\nstatfwho are viewed as leaders and we try to have a well\r\n\r\n\r\nbalanced core team. The subcommittees or design \r\n\r\nteams are open to anyone who is interested; likewise, \r\n\r\nany member of the staff can propose that a new design \r\nteam be formed around any issue of concern. There is \r\nalso an attempt to identify the strong parent advocates \r\nin the community, people who have a long history of \r\ninvolvement in the school and who can be counted on \r\nto bring other parents into the process. In addition, \r\nwhere applicable, students who are respected by their \r\npeers and who have an interest in school improvement \r\nare identified. Especially in the beginning, when things \r\nare just getting off the ground, the question of who is \r\ninvolved is critical to the credibility ofthe whole undertaking. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe in this program not only \r\nbecause itwill make teachers/eel more \r\ninvolved, give them more ownership, but \r\nbecauseUwfllintprovelearning.lbars \r\nthe botto\", line. \r\n\r\nThis group then takes part in fairly intensive training \r\nin communication and group dynamics. The particular \r\nmethod that we use is a modification of a problemsolving \r\nprocess called the Delphi technique, which is \r\ndesigned to help people reach consensus on the resolution \r\nof a problem by constantly re-examining the nature \r\nof the problem. Similar to the process used by the \r\nUnited Auto Workers and General Motors in their new \r\nSaturn agreement, it forces people to continually rethink \r\ntheir pOSitions with a view toward consensus. The \r\ntraining in group dynamiCS and decision making is \r\nimportant; and it\'s ongoing, not a one-shot workshop. \r\n\r\nThis core committee then spends a considerable \r\namount of time developing what we call a vision of \r\nexcellence for their school: How we can make this \r\nschool the best possible school, both in the short run \r\nand in the long run? Example: At my school, Hammond \r\nHigh, our original SIP team outlined ten specific goals \r\nthat we felt Hammond High should W9rk toward over, \r\nsay, a five-year period. Following that, subcommittees \r\nwere created to try and design programs to meet those \r\ngoals. One ofour target areas was professional development, \r\nto do something that might really help teachers. \r\nOut of that came a mentoring program through which \r\ntwo of our faculty are released half time to work with \r\nteachers who want to become more effective. \r\n\r\nAs to the question of administrator involvement on \r\nthe design teams -sometimes they are part ofa committee, \r\nsometimes not.

Those discussions -and the final decisionwill \r\nbe made by the math teachers onl)!, unless the \r\nschedule changes they devise have an impact on the rest \r\nof the school, in which case there will, of course, have to \r\nbe broader involvement. I want to add here that, if a \r\nprincipal is part of a SIP committee, it doesn\'t mean his \r\nor her opinion weighs any differently in reaching a \r\ndecision than does the opinion of any other member of \r\nthe committee. The administrator is there not as an \r\nadministrator but as a peer. For this reason, we have said \r\nthat a principal should never serve as the SIP committee \r\nchairperson. \r\n\r\nBoth the school administration and the \r\nunion are committed tofinding a way to \r\nbuild this process into the \r\n\r\nreguLarschoolda~ \r\n\r\nIn terms of how a final decision is made, we proceed \r\non the basic principle that underlies the whole system, \r\nwhich is that those who are affected by the decision, \r\nthose who are closest to it, those who have expertise in \r\nthe area, those who will be responsible for carrying it \r\nout, those who will be living with the decision are the \r\nones who should make it. If the proposal affects the \r\nentire faculty, then the entire faculty would be involved. \r\nIfit\'s something more limited -a change in the kinderÂ· \r\ngarten program -we encourage input and involveÂ· \r\nment from the entire faculty, but the actual decision \r\nwould be made by the kindergarten teachers and \r\nwhoever else might be part of the SIP design team \r\nlooking at that issue. In almost all cases, if the SIP \r\nproblemÂ·solving technique is followed, a group should \r\nbe able to reach consensus. However, in instances \r\nwhere someone is being unreasonably recalcitrant and \r\nwhere the overwhelming majority wants to move \r\nahead, they do so. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, ifa \r\nproposal conflicts with an existing state or school board \r\npolicy or with language in our collective bargaining \r\ncontract, then a more\' involved process of resolution \r\nkicks in. Let me add here, with regard to the whole \r\nprogram, that it is still quite new. Many situations and \r\nproblems can\'t be anticipated; we just have to deal with \r\nthem as they arise. We are working out the kinks as we \r\ngo along. \r\n\r\nMcPike: Give us some more examples of what the \r\nSIP committees have been dOing. Are they jumping \r\nright into major policy areas, or taking it slow? I \r\nWOUldn\'t be surprised if the latter were true, because \r\nyou\'re talking about a significant shift in roles, and it \r\n\r\n14 AMERICAN EDUCATOR \r\n\r\n~~\r\n\r\n\r\nmight take some time forpeople w n used to \r\nhaving authority beyond their classrooms to see themÂ· \r\n\r\n. selves as responsible for the larger questiOns involved \r\nin running a schooL \r\nO\'Rourke: Well, it varies, but generally you\'re right. \r\nThere is a slow but clear shifting of roles and responsibilities \r\ntaking place, and it takes time. To use my own \r\nschool as an example again, the first question we took \r\nup was how to get students out of the halls and into the \r\nclassrooms. That was a terribly important issue to us, \r\nbut dealing with it didn\'t suggest the same kind of shift \r\nin authority that other issues that we later got involved \r\nin do -like selecting the new principal for our school, \r\nwhich is something we subsequently played a big role \r\nin. \r\nNow that SIP has been in place in a few schools for a \r\ncouple years and in all schools since September 1985, \r\nSIP committees are moving into more and more areas of \r\ndecision making. I was ata meeting of SIP chairs just \r\nrecently where the ideas -and the desire to share ideas \r\n-were fiying left and right. But let me give you jlist a \r\nfew examples of what has taken place to date. \r\nMorton Elementary School has formulated a new polÂ· \r\nicy on homework. They\'ve also directed monies to be \r\nspent on certain computer equipment they felt they \r\nneeded, and they\'ve ou~tted a portable C()mputer u~t \r\nfor the lower grades. \r\nKenwood Elementary School has restructured its \r\nreading program. Spohn Middle School has moved to a \r\n\"clustering\" schedule for its students, which provides \r\nmore time for teachers to meet to discuss curriculum \r\nand student progress and to have more fiexibility to \r\nhold conferences with students and parents. Scott Middle \r\nSchool -and I should note here that improving \r\nparental and community involvement has been an area \r\nstressed by all the SIP committees-has trained a group \r\nthat it calls \"computer moms\" to help in the computer \r\nrooms. On quite a different level, one SIP team is taking a \r\nlook at teacher evaluation. They feel that there may be a \r\nbetter, a more effective, a more meaningful way to evaluate \r\nteachers than the way it is now done. They are \r\nlooking for something that not only assures quality but \r\nalso improves teaching. They\'ve been gathering inforÂ· \r\nmation from around the country and they\'ve been to \r\nToledo, Ohio, to study the program the AFT local there \r\nhas put into place. \r\nOne more example: Lafayette Elementary School has \r\nrevamped its whole kindergarten program. The student \r\npopulation at that school is generally from very lowincome \r\nand highly transient families, and many of the \r\nyoungsters come to school woefully ill prepared for a \r\ntraditional program. After a tremendous amount of \r\nresearch by the kindergarten teachers and numerous \r\ndiscussions with as many parents as pOSSible, the faculty \r\nvoted to establish a junior/senior kindergarten program \r\nthat will provide a wide range of handsÂ·on activities for \r\nchildren who aren\'t developmentally ready for a traditional \r\nkindergarten curriculum, as well as a tranSitional \r\nfirst grade. \r\nThis example reminds me of something that is happening \r\nthat I think is very important. Teachers are clamoring \r\nfor more information, for current stateÂ·ofÂ·the-art \r\nresearch on every aspect of curriculum, of school \r\norganization, of teaching practice. They want the latest \r\n\r\nSPRING 1987 \r\n\r\n\r\n.~iiiiiiiiiii..~.-\r\n\r\n\r\nn \r\n. urnaIs\' they want workshops; they want to know what prokssional faculty In all the decisi~Qlather school districts have tried, and what has worked ing in their schools, not as a peripherahctivity but as a \r\nand what asn t. . broadened definition ofwhat a professional teacher is.

The reason we did this is \r\nthat one of the problems with the old model of school \r\ngovernance was that too many projects and policies got \r\n\r\nfl \r\n\r\nlocked in simply due to stagnation: \"Well, they\'ve always \r\n\r\n\\ J \r\n\r\nbeen there. We\'ve always done it that war.\" Tradition. So \r\nwe feel that if something is worthwhile, it can stand \r\n\r\nl annual scrutiny. \r\n\' J Second, the process requires that criteria be estabrt \r\nlished to evaluate each project. How do we know it\'s \r\n\r\nP \r\nP \r\nworking? The criteria must be very clearly spelled out \r\nright from the start of the project or the implementation \r\nof something new. At the end of the grading period or \r\nthe semester or whatever the time period, an evaluation \r\nr 1 based on the agreed-to criteria is presented to the facUlty \r\nso that they can make a considered decision as to\'. J whether the project should be continued. For example, \r\none SIP team at a middle schoolwas concerned about \r\n\r\nfl \r\n\r\n, . the low level of parent involvement and teacher/parent \r\n-~ contact. They came up with a new arrangement\r\n\r\nJ \r\n\r\nwhereby parents would have to come to the school in \r\nthe evening to pick up report car_ds and meet with \r\n\r\nr]\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\ni teachers. They felt that the evening hours were crucial \r\n\\ J to parents in this community being able to come. This \r\ncalled for an alteration of the working day for teachers, \r\n-f } whereby they came in later in the day and then worked \r\n\r\n\" \r\n\r\nthat evening. The faculty voted to implement it for a \r\nL J grading period. At the end of the grading period, they \r\nevaluated it. They said it\'s working based on this data: X \r\ni 1 number of parents came last year, X number of parents \r\ncame this year, and look at the difference. By the way, it\r\n\r\n~ j \r\n\r\nwas a smashing success. \r\n\r\nr -, This review process may sound like a small thing, but \r\nit isn\'t. The idea of accountability based on observable, \r\nmeasurable data at the end of a specific time period is so \r\ndifferent from the way school districts are typically run, \r\n\r\nf 0 \r\nwhere too often no one knows who made what decision \r\nor when or why; someone, sometime, decided that \r\n\r\n-Ie â€¢ \r\n\r\nthings would be such and such a way and they are. No \r\none\'s responsible; everyone complains and passes the \r\nbuck. We\'re moving away from that attitude. \r\n\r\nr , I McPike: Let mego back to a point thatyou touched \r\n\r\non earlier. Most ofthe issues taken up by SIP committees \r\nare pedagogical ones, or they are questions of \r\nschool organization, school climate, community \r\ninvolvemen~ and student behavior. With some exceptions, \r\nthese are not topics that are typically addressed \r\nin a collective bargaining contract. The contract is not \r\ngoing to have language on how to best structure a \r\nreading program for the primary grades. But sometimes \r\nthere will be overlap and possible conflict. You \r\nmentioned, for example, the case ofa SIP committee \r\nthat is looking into a new system for evaluating teachers \r\nin its schoo~ and I\'m sure your contract spellS out \r\nin fairly preCise detail the procedures for teacher evaluation. \r\nThere are undoubtedly other examples in \r\n\r\nwhich SIP proposals conflict with language that \r\nyou\'ve negotiated in the contract. Now what happens? \r\nThe master contract says one thing; the SIP committee \r\ncalls for something quite different. \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: Well, it depends on the situation. Ifthe SIP \r\nproposal affects only a small group of teachers at a \r\nschool and if those teachers and their SIP team are \r\nunanimous in wanting to proceed with implementing \r\n\r\n\r\nis not a bar. We would not-intervene 0 unds that \r\nit was setting a bad precedent for other schools -or On \r\nany grounds. We would not pass judgment or impose \r\nthe language of the master contract if that\'s not What \r\nthose teachers wanted. And it would not surprise me \r\nthat different groups of teachers come up with a procedure \r\nor a program or a reorganization that they like \r\nbetter than what is contained in the contract. \r\n\r\nWe have a very good collective bargaining contract. \r\nWe have it because we\'re <1 very strong union. We\'ve \r\nbeen the bargaining agent since 1970, and we have a \r\nmembership of 96 percent of the teachers; the other 4 \r\npercent pay a representation fee. We have a comprehensive \r\nmaster contract built up over a number of years, and \r\nwe are very proud of the language in that contract. But \r\nthat doesn\'t mean it is the best language for all teachers \r\nin all situations. After all, each and every proviSion of the \r\ncontract does not and cannot reflect the preference of \r\neach and every teacher, unless teachers have totally \r\nidentical opinions on every topic, which they obviously \r\ndon\'t: Where there are divided opinions, the cohtract \r\ncan only reflect the majority, and even that, of course, is \r\nsubject to what\'we are actually able to negotiate. So for \r\nvarious issues, there\'s bound to be teachers who would \r\nprefer something other than what\'s in the contract. \r\n\r\nThe SIP process we\'ve put together, since it is \r\ndecentralized decision making, makes it possible for \r\nmore teachers to exercise their judgment as to what \r\nthey think is best for themselves and their school, while \r\nstill retaining the strength that can only come through a \r\nmaster contract. Don\'t forget, this is not a rejection or a \r\nweakening of collective bargaining, but rather an expansion. \r\nWe negotiated language in our master contract which \r\nwas overwhelmingly ratified by teachers -that \r\nsets forth the purpose and procedures of SIP. In so \r\ndoing, we have indirectly but quite dramatically \r\nexpanded the scope of what is bargainable. \r\n\r\nAlso, because the school-site committees are based \r\non shared decision making, we are moving away from \r\nthe \"us vs. them\" stance that is characteristic of traditional \r\nlabor-management relationships. Solving problems, \r\nrather than assigning blame and responsibility to \r\none side or the other, is becoming the operating principle. \r\nThat is a fundamental shift in attitude. \r\n\r\nNow, to get back to your original question, if a SIP \r\nproposal affects the entire faculty at a school-let\'s take \r\nthe example you used of a new teacher evaluation sys\r\n\r\n\r\n1be SIP process makes itpossiiJlefor \r\nmore teachers to exercise theirjudgment \r\nas to what they think is bestfor \r\nthemselves and their school, while still \r\nretaining the strength that can only come \r\nthrough a master contract. \r\n\r\nSPRING 1987 \r\n\r\nL j \r\n\r\nt ) \r\n\r\n, \r\n\r\n\r\n, \r\n\r\n, j \r\n\r\nt their idea, that\'s it, they go ahead.

Before I explain how this works, let \r\n\r\nme emphasize again that before such a vote would be \r\n\r\ntaken, there would be extensive small-group discussion \r\n\r\nthat would probably result in modifications of the orig\r\n\r\n\r\ninal proposal based on the opinions and objections that \r\n\r\nsurfaced. The SIP committee doesn\'t just formulate an \r\n\r\nidea and put it to a yes or no vote, up or down. They try \r\n\r\nto work toward a consensus. \r\n\r\nBut after that process is completed, there would be a \r\nvote. The procedure for this vote, by the way, is spelled \r\nout very precisely in our collective bargaining contract. \r\nThe voting is scaled from zero to five, from very negative \r\nto very enthusiastic. Anyone who votes zero retains the \r\nright to file a grievance under the normal procedures \r\nspelled out in the contract. They may decide not to file a \r\ngrievance, but they have the right to do so within the \r\nregular time limits set forth in the contract, and if they \r\ndo, the union will back them in the grievance. The \r\nresolution of that grievance could result in anything. It \r\ncould result in the elimination of the SIP project. It \r\ncould result in an arbitrator or someone along the way \r\nsaying to the SIP team, \"Go back to the drawing board \r\nand try to come up with a different approach to try to \r\nmeet the objections ofthe teacher or teachers who filed \r\nthe grievance.\" And it could also result in exempting the \r\ngrievant from having to participate in the SIP project. \r\n\r\nMcPike: Theoretically, one person could veto a project \r\nthat 99percentofthe faculty ata particular school \r\nwant to go ahead with. \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: Yes, that\'s possible but it\'s not likely, given \r\nthe normal group dynamics ofpeople working together \r\nand wanting to get along and the discussions that take \r\npllJce as part of SIP. And remember this only applies to \r\nthose instances in which there are conflicts with our \r\ncontract, which aren\'t many. But we may have gone \r\noverboard. We deliberately erred on the side ofcaution. \r\nPerhaps it should take a certain percentage of people to \r\nblock a program, or there might be some way of maintaining \r\nexisting conditions for the objecting party without \r\nstopping the entire program. I\'m not sure. \r\n\r\nMcPike:AsI understand it, in a situation in which a \r\nSIP proposal conflicts with the contract, an individual \r\ncan file a grievance, but the union as an institution \r\ncan\'t. That\'s new, isn\'t it? Frequently, the union as the \r\nprotector of the contract would itself file a grievance \r\nover a violation of contract language. I recall your \r\ntelling me a story about how, some years back, as local \r\nunion president responsible for enforcing the contract, \r\nyou went into a school and stopped the faculty \r\nfrom implementing a program it had developed \r\nbecause some aspects ofthat program were in conflict \r\nwith the master contract. \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: Yes, I still remember that vividly. The \r\nschool was an elementary school and the teachers were \r\ninterested in developing a remedial reading program. \r\nThe socioeconomic level of the youngsters attending \r\nthat school was poor, and the teachers were discovering \r\nthat kids were coming to school unprepared. \r\n\r\nThe program the teachers developed violated a provision \r\nof the contract, and because we were worried \r\n\r\nSPRING 1987 \r\n\r\n~ \r\n\r\n\r\nabout setting a bad precedent,~;~eJance, intervened, and brought the program to a screeching \r\nhalt, even though many of the teachers in the \r\nbuilding were looking forward to implementing it. I was \r\nvery uncomfortable with the role I had to play. And I \r\nthOUght right then and there that there must be a way \r\nthat we can negotiate a master contract that would allow \r\nteachers within a given building to deviate from that \r\ncontract as long as there were certain mechanisms built \r\nin that would protect other teachers as well as themselves. \r\nI think we have now done \'that through SIP. \r\n\r\nSolving problems, rather than assigning \r\nblame and responsibility to one side or \r\nthe other, is becoming the operating \r\nprinciple. 1bat is a fundamental \r\nshift in attitude. \r\n\r\n\r\nMcPike: The degree Of shared decision making \r\nbetween teachers and administrators that you\'ve been \r\ndescribing is a radical departure from the authority \r\nrelationships and the divisions Of responsibility that \r\nare typical ofalmost every school district in this country. \r\nWhat changes in attitude, in mindset, do people \r\nhave to make in order to be able to work together in \r\nthis new configuration? Let\'s start with administrators. \r\nThe literature discussing the managerial and \r\norganizational changes that are taking place in the \r\nprivate sector is full Of stories describing the resistance \r\noffirstÂ· line supervisors, who often view any increase \r\nin worker involvement as an encroachment upon \r\ntheir authority, a threat to their power. What has been \r\nthe reaction in Hammond from principals and \r\nassistant principals, and what changes in their \r\nattitudes are necessary to make this process work? \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: One of the concepts of SIP is a redefinition \r\nof power. The traditional definition revolves around \r\nan economic scarcity theory: that power is limited, so \r\nthat if I have less. vou have more, and vice versa. What \r\nwe\'re talking abo~t in Hammond is a redefinition, an \r\nenlargement of the concept of power. We\'re not talking \r\nabouttaking power away from one group and giving it \r\nto another. We see this new governance structure rather \r\nas broadening the base ofdecision making in a way that \r\nempowers everyone involved because it results in better, \r\nmore informed, more accepted programs and policies, \r\nwith everyone on board.

Others have embraced it totally and willingly and \r\nwith enthusiasm. 1b a large degree, it depends on the \r\npersonality and the history and the tradition of the \r\nparticular building and person. We\'ve also seen some \r\nadministrators whose initial reaction was very negative \r\nbut who have now done a complete turnaround. I can \r\nthink of individuals whom I would call the worst, the \r\nmost autocratic, who have gradually bought into this \r\nprocess over a period of two years or so and who are \r\nnow very comfortable with it. \r\n\r\nWhen people really believe that what they \r\nthink, what they say, what they do will \r\nmake a diJTerence, they take hold, they \r\nmake things happen. \r\n\r\nWhat has been indispensable in all of this is that SIP \r\nhas had the full commitment ofthe top administration of \r\nthe school district. This is especially essential in the \r\nbeginning when there are plenty of doubts floating \r\naround as to whether the administration is serious \r\nabout sharing authority or whether this is some new \r\ngimmick. Dave Dickson, the superintendent here, \r\n\r\n;\'brought with him to Hammond a very open style of \r\nmanagement and a belief in the principle that those \r\naffected by a decision oUght to have some input into \r\nmaking that decision. He is by personality and style a \r\nperson who governs through consensus. In addition, we \r\nhave a school board composed of five very secure individuals \r\nwho are willing to listen to a superintendent \r\nwho says to them that we can enhance education in \r\nHammond, Indiana, by involving professionals in decision \r\nmaking. That is very important. If there is a lesson \r\nhere for other school boards and other superintendents, \r\nit is that they have nothing to fear from sharing decision \r\nmaking. The school system is not going to fall apart; it\'s \r\ngoing to get bette.: . \r\n\r\nMcPike: What about teachers~ What effect has SIP \r\nhad on them and whatkinds Of changes have they had \r\nto make? \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke: There has been a tremendous release of \r\nenergy and creativity. It\'s true what they say about this \r\nsense of ownership, it\'s very powerful. When people \r\nreally believe that what they think, what they say, what \r\nthey do will make a difference, they take hold, they \r\nmake things happen, they look for what needs changing \r\nand they change it, be it in the system or in themselves. \r\nThe result here has been a very noticeable feeling of \r\nprofessional pride and investment in \"this school as my \r\nschool.\" \r\n\r\n46 AMERICAN EDUCATOR \r\n\r\nThis doesn\'t happen autQm~a \r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of cynicism that has grown up \r\n\r\n. over the years, which must be overcome first. There are \r\na lot of teachers who have served on textbook adoption \r\ncommittees but not had the textbook they recommended \r\nselected; many who have put time and research \r\ninto developing better curriculum only to be told in the \r\nend there had to be one unifonn curriculum; many who \r\nwere assured that their ideas were good ones or that \r\ntheir \"input was valued,\" but when it came around to \r\nbudget time, there always were \"higher priorities\" than \r\nthe programs the teachers said were needed. These \r\nteachers\' enthusiasm and their willingness to be \r\ninvolved has been drained over the years. It has to be \r\nrestored, and that will take time. \r\nSecond is the fact that many teachers have accepted a \r\nlimited definition of their role. This is a result of years of \r\nlack of empowerment. Teachers were never given the \r\ntime or the authority to develop a master schedule; they \r\nwere just told to show up for their classes at a certain \r\nhour. They were never asked to develop a disciplip.e \r\npolicy for their school; they were just told to keep order \r\nin their classroom. \r\nOne often hears about the \"autonomy\" teachers have \r\nin their classroom, but most teachers realize that it is a \r\nlimited autonomy, that all the decisions and polici~ \r\noutside of their control eventually find their way into \r\nthe classroom, impinge upon that autonomy, and profoundly \r\nlimit or expand a teacher\'s ability to do a good \r\njob. The boundaries ofprofessional authority have been \r\ndrawn quite narrowly. As a result, in my opinion, not \r\nonly have teachers been robbed of a full expression of \r\ntheir professional abilities, but the schools and our students \r\nhave been denied the full benefits of their expertise. \r\nI really do believe that if education refonn is going \r\nto mean anything at all in this country, and we\'re not just \r\npaying lip service to it, we must redefine what it means \r\nto be a classroom teacher. If we are really going to \r\nemerge as a profession, we need more control over all \r\nthe conditions that affect teaching and learning. A lot of \r\nteachers are ready for that; they need no prompting, \r\nthey just need to know that they\'re not wasting their \r\ntime. Others need to really begin to see themselves in a \r\nnew way. And this will happen, I\'m convinced of that. As \r\nnew models emerge, as people begin to see what is \r\npossible, as they build their confidence, as they restore \r\ntheir trust, as events prove to them that they will be \r\ntaken seriously, things will change. \r\nMcPike: As I heard you say once, in response to a \r\nquestion about how hard it would be to bring real \r\nchange to a system that has stayed the same for so \r\nlong: \"Look, we\'re just one local union in Hammond, \r\nIndiana, we didn\'t know everything, we took some \r\nrisks, and we are making it happen. \" \r\nO\'Rourke: That\'s true, we are. And so can others. 0 \r\n\r\nInitial and ongoing support-in theform ofideas, \r\ntraining, andfUnding -for the School Improvement \r\nProcess has come from the Institute for the Development \r\nofEducational Activities (IDEA), an ami ofthe \r\nCharles Kettering Foundation, and from the Eli Lilly \r\nEndowment, with additional funding from the Indiana \r\nCriminal Justice Institute and the Indiana State \r\nDepartment Of Education \r\n\r\nSPRING 1987 \r\n\r\n\r\nBy Jean Latz Griffin \r\n\r\nEducatIOn writer \r\n\r\nPilot ,prggramsthat would enable \r\nteachers to have more say in \r\nhow schools are run, what curricu-, 1 lum is used and how students arer taught will becomo\' part of nesoti-\r\n\r\nJ \r\n\r\nations between the Chicago Board \r\nof Education and the Chicago \r\nTeachers Union, according to \r\nunion president Jacqueline\r\n\r\nfJ Vaughn.. \r\nRestructuring schools to allow \r\nteachers more control over their \r\njobs is a recommendation expected \r\nto be adopted Sunday by the \r\nAmerican Federation of Teachers, \r\nwhich has been meeting in Chicago \r\nthis week.\r\n\r\n1 \r\n\r\nVaughn said she hopes the\r\n\r\nrJ \r\nschool board would be receptive to \r\nsuch a plan.

And though the program was \r\nL j disgarded, the school bOllrd still \r\nexerts stricter controls on its \r\nteachers than do many other systems, \r\nincluding a recent directIve \r\nthat tells teachers how many hours \r\nof homework they must assign \r\neach night at each grade level. \r\n\r\nIn Chicago, educators se\'elf ~rol \r\n\r\n\r\nSuch \"oppressive supervision,\" \r\nin which\' teachers are told what \r\nand how to teach, is driving the \r\nmost talented people away from \r\nthe profession, said Albert Shanker, \r\npresident of the teacher federation. \r\n\r\n\r\nVaughn said she believed the \r\nbiggest non-monetary obstacle for \r\nthe school board would be to having \r\nteachers take over responsibili.\r\nties that now belong to Â·principals. \r\n\r\nPrincipals\' organizations around \r\nthe natton have objected to that \r\nrecommendation, which was made \r\nin May by the Carnegie Forum on \r\nEducation and the Economy and \r\nwhich is mirrored in the federation\'s \r\nproposal. \r\n\r\nVaughn said she is encouraged \r\nby progress made in a joint committee \r\nof union and board members \r\nthat has been meeting amicably \r\nfor the last year to work out \r\nhow lllinois\' comprehensive sebool \r\nreform plan will work in Chicago, \r\nschools. \r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n\"At first, the board people\' were \r\napprehensive,\" said Vaughn. \"But \r\nas we came in with positive sug~ \r\ngestions on how new ideas co~ld \r\nwork, they became more recepuve. \r\n\r\nTheir only question now seems to \r\nbe. \'How much will it cost?\'\" \r\nVaughn said she sent a draft \r\n\r\nr ~ \r\n\r\nI Why I&GoVemor CUomo New York asaawna\' \r\ntile State Boardof Regents? e bas called iUn \"eUÂ· \r\nIÂ·, tist group\" that exercises \"irresponsible leaderÂ· \r\nr â€¢ I ship\" in~.Thole are p!\'OpCIIiticD that need \r\nI more evideace ad, it.uue. 111m. .,ecifk: remedies \r\n\r\n\r\nL j \r\nI dwlthe~bu\"etp~-, \r\n111e RepDIa decree ,~anc:lbroad pon.. \r\n\r\n, . \r\ncies for ~UId private ecIucidoa at all levels,\r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nand select b :pammigjoaer of, Education. now \r\nl Gordon Ambac&Â· Tbe IS-member board alIo U..\r\n\r\nj \r\n\r\nceues anct dllc:fp1lne8 31 professtoaa, from pIIpi\r\n\r\n\r\nciaIIs to masseurs. aDd oversees Ubrut. aDIi I!No \r\n\r\nseems.

Mr. Wagner said he envisioned \r\n1,200 to 1,500 master teaching \r\npositions among the city\'s 65,000 school \r\nteachers. \r\n\r\nThe board president said the mentors \r\nwould be selected by peer review \r\n-\"similar to the way tenure decisions \r\nare made in a universi~y\" -with the \r\nprincipal of the school having the final \r\nsay, \r\n\r\nI \r\nI \r\ni Ms. Feldman,said shtl also favored \r\nmaking the master teacher program \r\npermanent, but had some reservations \r\n\r\nschools, as well as provide the best training \r\nfor newcomers. \r\n\r\nThere are similar master teacher pro-. \r\ngrams in California and Florida, as well as \r\nin school systems around New York State. \r\nNew York City got the lion\'s share $\r\n1.6 million -of the $4 million state grant; \r\nthe rest went to 20 other systems. \r\n\r\nMotivated but Ineffective \r\n\r\nOfficials of the New York City Board at \r\nEducation and the United FederationÂ· of \r\nTeachers, who jointly developed the pilot \r\nprogram, agreed that the training was badly \r\nneeded. \r\n\r\n\"You go to the schools and see well-motivated \r\nteachers totally incapable of controlling \r\na class,\" Mr. Wagner said. \r\n\r\n\"The board has been hiring a lot of people \r\nwithout any pedagogical training,\" said the \r\npresident of the teachers union, Sandra Feldman. \r\n\r\n\r\nabout the Wagner proposal. , \r\n\r\nOf the new salary, she :;aid, \"Obviously \r\nthis has to be something rhat \r\ncomes on top of a generous salary offer.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\"This cannot be a substitute for a \r\nsubstantial raising of the salary schedule \r\nfor all teachers,\" Ms, Feldman \r\nwent on. \"Our salaries are way be~ind \r\nthose of teachers in the surrounding \r\nmetropolitan area.\" \r\n\r\nShe also said she did not want the \r\nfinal deCision on who was chosen a \r\nmaster teacher left to the princip.al. \r\n\"We would want to negotiate a b~ter \r\nselection system, where the teac1iers \r\nwould have a greater say,\" she \'Said. \r\n\r\nMany of the 2,000 teachers hired this year, \r\nfor example, do not have degrees in education, \r\naccording to board officials. And because \r\nof an administrative error, two-thirds \r\nof the new teachers missed training sessions \r\nthat were held before school opened in Sep\r\n\r\n\r\n, tember. \r\nUnder the pilot program, each mentor is \r\nreleased from classroom duties 20 percent of \r\nthe school day, while the new teachers are \r\nreleased 40 percent of the time. \r\n: The new teachers spend part of the day as \r\nobservers in the mentors\' classrooms.

It may fall further. \r\n\'. The average age of the workforce \r\nincreased from 36 in 1973 to 42 in 1985. \r\nThis aging is expected to continue. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ The aging of the workforce\" \r\ncoupled with Proposition 2\'h\', has \r\ngreatly diminished the participation of \r\nthe young in teaching.

Of those that did, the \r\npercentage of minority graduates declined \r\nfrom 13 percent to about 6 \r\npercent between 1982 and 1986. The \r\npercentages of minorities hired from \r\nthese programs were less than the \r\npercentages of the minority graduates. \r\nAccording to the report, \"This implies \r\neither a bias in the teaching system \r\nagainst hiring minority teachers or \r\ngreater job opportunities for minority \r\ncollege graduates who consequently \r\nchoose not to enter teaching.\" \r\n\\ j \r\n\r\nContract provides \r\n19% pay hikes \r\n\r\n, The Milton Educators Association \r\nhas ratified a three-year agreement \r\nwhich provides for a 19 percent \r\nincrease during the life of the contract. \r\n\\ , hi~~et~:a~~:!sy:~!~ ~:~ a6~ ~:~~:~: \r\nincreases in each of the second and \r\nthird years. \r\nIn addition, teachers holding a mas\r\n\r\n\r\nt , \r\nter\'s degree will receive a $500 increment \r\nin the third,yeaP of thet:ontract. \r\nThe MEA was successful in maintaining \r\nthe current work day schedule \r\n\r\n\'despite a sChool committee move to \r\n\r\n, , alter the schedule.

This \r\ninvolves issues of teacher compensation, restructuring the teaching profession, \r\nand revitali~ation of education to make teachers more likely to make \r\n\r\nlong term career commitments. \r\n\r\nThere \r\nwhich merit \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nBy \r\nto \r\nare many aspects of-the issue of teacher recruitment and retention \r\nattention. Some basic facts are important: \r\n\r\nthe mid 1980s the teachers trained during the 1950s will begin \r\nretire, creating large numbers of vacancies. More than 20 per\r\n\r\n\r\ncent of teachers active in 1971 were 50 years of age or older. \r\nâ€¢ The recent rise in the number of births will increase the enrollment \r\nin elementary schools, and, as this trend continues over the \r\nnext ten to fifteen years, this will greatly increase the demand \r\nfor elementary teachers. \r\nâ€¢ Fewer college bound students are selecting education as their \r\nmajor field of study. In 1983, only 4.5 percent of college \r\nbound high school seniors selected education as their field of \r\nstudy. This is down from twenty two percent in 1962. \r\nâ€¢ The students entering education recently have not been those with \r\nthe highest measured academic performances. In 1982, those entering \r\neducation averaged 80 points below the national average in math and \r\nverbal skills, and ranked 26th in 29 academic fields surveyed. In \r\nthe National Longitudinal Study sample for the class of 1976, education \r\nmajors ranked fourteenth out of sixteen fields on SAT verbal \r\nscores, and twelfth of sixteen in college grade point average. \r\nâ€¢ As many as 50 percent of teachers who do enter the profession leave \r\nteaching by the seventh year, and those who remain are the least \r\nacademically able. Two-thirds to three-fourths leave after only \r\nfour years. \r\nâ€¢ Of factors that are cited by students for failure to pursue a \r\ncareer in education, the most common are low salary, lack of \r\nopportunity to earn sizable salary increases, generally poor \r\nworking conditions, and the lack of opportunity for professional \r\ngrowth and advancement. \r\nMain Points of Controversy \r\n\r\nAny number of suggestions have been made about how to solve some of \r\n\r\nthese problems. This section will briefly describe some of those ideas. \r\n\r\n\r\nr1 . \r\n\r\nn Page 2 \r\n\r\n\r\nl \r\n\r\nI rj \r\n\r\nr~ \r\n\r\nt J \r\n\r\nrl \r\n\r\n(\' \r\n\r\nt j \r\n\r\nr 1 \r\n\r\n: \r\n\r\nr l \r\nI \r\n\r\n-I: J \r\n\r\nr 1 \r\n\r\nL j \r\n\r\nl ~ \r\n\r\n.r \r\n\r\n\r\nl! \r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\nTeacher Salary Levels. To make teaching attractive to high quality \r\nindividuals, the financial incentives of the profession will need to be \r\nradically altered, both in terms of entry level salaries and career earnings. \r\nIn High School, Ernest Boyer recommended that \"salary averages for \r\nteachers be increased by at least 25 percent beyond the rate of inflation \r\nover the next three years, with immediate entry-level increases\" (B9yer, \r\n1983:168). This, of course, will be very costly and require an additional \r\ninvestment in education. . \r\n\r\nFinancial Incentives for College Students. There is a need for financial \r\ni~centives to attract top college students into teaching. Proposals \r\ninclude special scholarships for qualifying students, as well~as loan forgiveness \r\nprograms for those top students who will agree to teach for a \r\nspecified period of time. The hope is that these will attract bright and \r\nable college students to teaching. \\ \r\n\r\nShortage Area Salary Differentials. Some people have proposed salary \r\ndifferentials for teachers in shortage areas, such as science and mathematics. \r\nOthers questions whether the modest differentials will make any \r\nimpact at all on the supply of qualified teachers in those areas. The \r\nshortage of highly qualified new entrants in teaching goes well beyond a \r\nfew critical areas and the issue needs to be considered in its broader \r\ncontext. \r\n\r\nSalary Schedule Reforms. In addition to ra1s1ng general salary levels \r\nfor teachers, other suggestions have been made to shorten traditional \r\nteacher salary schedules to 3 to 5 steps so that a beginning teacher could \r\nloo~.forward to significant salary improvements early in the teaching \r\ncareer and veteran teachers could reach career salary levels earlier. Such \r\nproposals could significantly increase career earnings for teachers and make \r\nthe profession far more attractive to well qualified candidates. \r\n\r\nSchool Organization and Management. In order to attract and retain \r\nhigh quality teachers, some observers have noted that fundamental changes \r\nmust take place in school organization and management in order to expand \r\nthe professional role of the teacher and make teaching more satisfying. \r\nThis would allow teachers greater opportunities for career development \r\nand advancement. \r\n\r\nTeacher Preparation and Licensing. Other suggestions have been made \r\nfor attracting high quality individuals into teaching which relate to \r\nissues in teacher preparation and licensing. These are discussed in another \r\npaper in this series. \r\n\r\nAFT Policy \r\n\r\nIn the comprehensive policy statement on education reform adopted by \r\nthe 1983 AFT Convention, the issue of finding ways to ~ecruit and keep a \r\nquality teaching force was made one of the major items on the AFT agenda. \r\nWe do not have any final answers in this area, but there are some concerns \r\nand views which must be taken into account: \r\n\r\nl ) \r\n\r\nl > \r\n\r\n\r\nn \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nn \r\nn \r\nPage 3 \r\n\r\nâ€¢ The AFT believes that incentive payor discretionary merit \r\npay is not the best solution to the problem and that these\r\nn proposals divert attention away from the real issues. \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nThe AFT believes that a radical restructuring of teacher \r\ncompensation systems is necessary. Beginning teacher salary \r\nlevels must be increased radically to make them competitiveÂ· \r\nwith entry salaries in other professional fields. Salary\r\n. r ~I\r\n\r\nI \r\nj \r\n: \r\nschedules must encourage good teachers to stay in the profession \r\nby allowing teachers to reach ~areer salary levels earlier and \r\nby increasing total lifetime earnings. \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nThe AFT believes that schools and teaching need to be restructured \r\nto make teaching more intellectually stimulating and professionally \r\nsatisfying. This involves providing opportunities for professiohal \r\ndevelopment and enrichment as well as improving school climate and \r\ndiscipline. Also needed are changes to allow teachers more control \r\n-r\'1 over instruction and a separation of the functions of administration \r\nand educational leadership in schools.\r\n\r\nII \r\n\r\nAn Annotated Bibliography\r\n\r\nr I \r\n\r\n! \r\nl J Adler, Mortimer J. 1982.

These same statistics are mirrored \r\nall over the country. Where will the \r\nteachers come from to take their place, \r\nand will they be talented and wellqualified? \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers \r\nhas found the answer in its own backyard-\r\nits schools. To help head off a \r\nteacher shortage, the PFr, in a joint effort \r\nwith the Board of Education, is recruiting \r\nfuture teachers from the ranks of the \r\ndistrict\'s most promising high school \r\nstudents. Launched last year, the teacher \r\nrecruitment project offers jobs and competitive \r\nsalaries to outstanding students if \r\nthey do well in college and choose \r\nteaching as their career. Officials are \r\ntargeting honor roll students and other \r\nstudents who are recommended by their \r\nteachers. \r\n\r\nThe program is part of the Teacher \r\nProfessionalism Project, a negotiated \r\nprovision of the PFr contract that \r\nencourages joint efforts between management \r\nand the union to improve the \r\ndistrict\'s schools and teaching. \"The \r\nunion has the responsibility to make sure \r\nthat we can replenish the ranks and bring \r\nin top-notch teachers,\" says PFr president \r\nAI Fondy. \"We get a lot of \r\nsatisfaction from this program. and \r\nnobody can argue that it\'s not good for \r\nthe schools.\" So far, union and school \r\ndistrict representatives have visited six of \r\nthe city\'s high schools to urge students to \r\ngo into teaching, and judging from \r\nstudent reaction, the program is an \r\nunqualified success. \r\n\r\n\"The response has been terrific.\" says \r\nPFr vice president Paul Francis. Cards \r\nfilled out by students attending the six \r\npresentations indicated that 117 are interested \r\nin entering the profession. \"We\'re \r\ntalking about 117 excellent students \r\nwanting to become teachers,\" says Fran\r\n\r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\n\r\nr1 \r\n\r\ni \' \r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\nIr 1 \r\nl J \r\n, \r\n\r\nr 1 \r\nI \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nL .J \r\nl \" \r\n\r\n\\ . \r\n\r\nIJ&&IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII\'lal~gilÂ£IJjJJÂ£Â£Â£I.\r\n\r\n~1i1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l1l\"2511111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\"lIlIiil~JL \r\n\r\ncis. \"It will be wonderful if most will teaching is an extremely important proassembly, \r\nincluding teacher Donald \r\ncany through ... fession ... we need the best people we can Demeter, chairman of the physics depart\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-seven of those students expressrecruit. \r\n.. ment, who observes that since the \r\ning a definite interest in teaching attend \"The last 15 years of layoffs and no recruitment program began, more stuLangley \r\nHigh School and were among hiring are behind us now,\" fundy tells dents have expressed an interest in \r\n217 students who heard a presentation on the students.

Much of that conventional wisÂ· \r\nMichael W.

A teacher\'s receiving \r\ntenura, for example, might \r\nbe a cause for public celebration \r\nwithin the echoo1 building, he said. \r\n\r\nInstead ofshuttingteachera away \r\nin classrooms, Mr. Schlechty sug. \r\ngested, the perfonnance ofboth new \r\nand experienced teachera would be \r\n\"highly visible\" to othera.

Panel Urges \r\n\r\n\r\nBy Robert Rothman \r\n\r\nA commission appointed by the \r\n\r\nMassachusetts legislature has \r\n\r\nadopted a far-ranging proposal to \r\n\r\nprovide funds and relax regulations \r\n\r\nfor schools that experiment with \r\n\r\nnew forms of organization to give \r\n\r\nmore authority to teachers. \r\n\r\nIn a report issued this month, the \r\ncommission said its proposals, modeled \r\nafter the reforms recommended \r\nby the Carnegie Thsk Fbrce on Education \r\nand the Economy in its 1986 \r\nreport, A Nation Prepared, are \r\nbased on the \'\'principle that the essential \r\nresource for improved education \r\nis already inside the school: determined, \r\nintelligent, and capable \r\n\r\nteachers.\" . \r\n\"By recognizing their experience \r\nand commitment,\" the report con\r\n\r\n\r\ntinues, \"we will allow teachers, \r\nworking together, the freedom to exercise \r\ntheir professionaljudgment to \r\ndetemvne the best way to carry out \r\n\r\ntheir lfasic mission-ec:lucating students.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to recommending the \r\nestablishment of so-called \"Carne-. \r\ngie schools,\" the panel, known as the \r\nspecial commission on the conditions \r\nof teaching, also proposed providing \r\nfinancial rewards to lowachieving \r\nschools that raise students\' \r\ntest scores and lower dropout \r\nrates. And it urged that extra funds \r\nbe provided to districts to raise \r\nteacher salaries to $20,000, from. the \r\ncurrent minimum of $18,000. \r\n\r\nIn addition, it suggested that the \r\n\r\n\"We proposed \r\nremovinga number \r\nofthings that stand \r\nin the way of \r\nteachers\' \r\nexercising their \r\ndiscretion. \" \r\n\r\n-State Senator Richard A. Kraus \r\n\r\nstate set aside funds for the establishment \r\nof \'\'professional-development\" \r\nschools to train teachers. \r\n\r\nIn a related development, a second \r\ncommission, also appointed by \r\nthe legislature, proposed additional \r\nfunding for grants to local school-improvement \r\ncouncils. The councils, \r\ncreated in 1985, link parents, teachers, \r\nadministrators, and students in \r\nan effort to plan improvements in individual \r\nschools. \r\n\r\nThacher Empowerment \r\n\r\nTaken together, the reforms proposed \r\nby the two panels would help \r\nraise the level of professionalism \r\namong teachers and attract new recruits \r\nto the profession, said State \r\nSenator Richard A. Kraus, the cochairman \r\nof the legislature\'s joint \r\n\r\n\r\neducation committee and cO-chairman \r\nof both study groups.\' \r\n\r\n\'We heard over and over again \r\nthat teachers\' professional status is \r\nriot taken seriously,\" Senator Kraus \r\nsaid. \'\'Rather than issue an order \r\nsaying, \'Treat teachers as professionals,\' \r\nwe proposed removing a \r\nnumber of things that stand in the \r\nway of teachers\' exercising their discretion.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\'We keep hearing about teacher \r\nempowerment,\" added Nancy Finkelstein, \r\npresident ofthe Massachusetts \r\nTeachers Association and a \r\nmember of the commission on the \r\nconditions of teaching. \"The Carnegie-\r\nschools proposal will do just \r\nthat.\" . \r\n\r\nMs. Finkelstein noted that the \r\ncommission was originally formed \r\n\r\nin 1985 to examine teacher salarieE \r\nAfter the Carnegie task force issueÂ« \r\nits report last year, however, th, \r\npanel successfully petitioned th, \r\nlegislature to broaden its mandat \r\nto include issues of teacher empow \r\nerment, she noted. \r\n\r\nThe union president added tha \r\nthe commission would have liked 1:; \r\naddress the issues of class sizes, rna \r\nterials, and teachers\' retiremen \r\nbenefits, but did not because it rec \r\nognized that funding to implemen \r\nrecommendations on those topic \r\nwould be limited. \r\n\r\nSenator Kraus and the panel< \r\nother co-chairman, State Represen \r\ntative Nicholas A.

In addition, he said, the fund \r\nwould enable the state to aware \r\nplanning grants for about 30 Carne \r\ngie schools and 10 professional-de \r\nvelopment schools. \r\n\r\nThe commission will seek \"sub \r\nstantially more money\" in fisca \r\n1989 to implement the proposals \r\nSenator Kraus said. \r\n\r\njf! \r\n\r\nI , . \r\n\r\n\r\n[1 \'I \r\n) \r\n\r\nn \r\n\r\n\r\nq\r\n\r\n\\ :J \r\n\r\nl ] \r\n\r\n\r\nrl \r\n\r\n~ \r\nj \r\n\r\nr \r\n\"1 \r\n\r\ni I \' \r\nl.J \r\n\r\n-{ \r\n\\ \r\n\r\n, \r\n) \r\n\r\nr \r\ni \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nl \r\nj \r\n\r\n\\ \r\n, \r\n\r\n\\ \r\n1 \r\n\r\nL \r\nj \r\n\r\nI J \r\n\r\nGo to the Head of the Class \r\n\r\nLeadership Critical for Restructured Schools \r\n\r\n\r\nHave you noticed that anyone and everyone who\r\n\r\nf.1)UCATION \r\n\r\ncan spell \"leadership\" is writing about it? COMMISSION During an age of early experimentation with a \r\nnew form ofgovernance, James Madison observed \r\n\r\nOF THE STATES \r\n\r\nthat education is the preparation of a people who \r\n\r\n\r\nmean to be their own governors. The experiment \r\nwas called \"democracy,\" and MadiSQn realized that \r\neven in the most just social order, all men are not \r\ncreated equal. That is why education emerged as \r\n\r\nthe most powerful agent of social transft\'rmation \r\nthen and remains so today. \r\n\r\nAs early as 1787, the Northwest Ordinance \r\ndecreed that \"morality and knowledge being \r\nnecessary to good government, and the happiness \r\nof mankind, schools and the means of education \r\nshall forever be encouraged.\" In these past few \r\nyean, in state after sta~, leaders in government, \r\neducation and industry have reaffirmed their \r\ncommitment to such principles. The problem is, \r\nthere are few Madisons among us and not since our \r\nfirst revolution has the need for individuals ofsuch \r\nvision and character been greater. \r\n\r\nWhy is it that that age saw ~uch a cluster of \r\nleadership in the likes of Madison, Jefferson, \r\nWashingion or Paine, to name only a few? Why is \r\nit that leadership has emerged now as the issue for \r\nthe remainder of the 1980s? What can we learn \r\nfrom history about the qualities of leadership and \r\nhow can education put these leamings to work to \r\nmake schools better? \r\n\r\nLeadership is quickly replacing literacy as the \r\nnew catchphrase in social commentary, But, like \r\nliteracy, and its many prefixes, our concept of \r\nleadership -and our efforts to fill a leadership \r\nvoid -are rooted in yesterday\'s assumptions and \r\nyesterday\'s national need. Just as it is time to \r\nidentify the literacy needs ofa coming generation, \r\nso too must we recognize the need for a new \r\nunderstanding and a new appreciation of leadership. \r\n\r\nHowcaD broItderparlkJpatioainpoIkydnelopIDtIJt \r\ncontribute to make IamiIlR better IUJd \r\ne~/Jtw ItadtnlJlp1 \r\n\r\nIn his book, \", .. the bestofeducations, \"a study \r\nof education reform initiatives in seven states, \r\nauthor William Chance notes that though certain \r\nindividuals have assumed ~ritical leadership responsibilities, \r\ncollaboration and broad local involvement \r\nhave been key to implementing constructive change \r\nat the school and classroom level\" \r\n\r\n\"While charismatic leadership and distinctive \r\nleadership styles were important,\" Chance writes, \r\n\"individuals were unable to accomplish the changes \r\nalone, and political coalitions were necessary in all \r\nof the important change states.\" \r\n\r\nThe movers and shakers in American education \r\nhave come to the conclusion that it is time to \r\nreinvent the wheel, That\'s going to require new \r\ninventivenessand tired as it may sound, the way to \r\nget it is \"empowerment.\" A year after the Carnegie \r\nForum on Education and the Economy issued its \r\nmanifestoon restructured schools, at least two states \r\nare taking steps in that direction. \r\n\r\nState legislators were so moved by testimony \r\nfrom a Seattle school principal, who said that state \r\n\r\nbureaucrats \'frequently relied on restrictive regulations \r\nto undermine innovative classroom and \r\nschoolwide practices, that they passed a law \r\nlimiting bureaucratic meddling in a new restructuring \r\nexperiment. \r\n\r\nThe ftrst step toward the restructuring of the \r\npublic schools in Washington was taken with \r\nGovernor Booth Gardner\'s signingofESSB-S479, \r\nwaiving state regulations for a pilot project group \r\nof21 school districts. State officials want to gauge \r\nthe effects of increased local decision-making \r\nauthority on learning. \r\n\r\nKey aspects of the law are: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nA commitment that all parties will work cooperatively \r\nduring the term of the pilot study \r\nâ€¢ \r\nThe call for a written agreement ofsupport\' from \r\nschool boards, admintsttators, parents, business \r\ncommunity and pennission to modify the local \r\nbargaining agreement for project activities \r\nâ€¢ \r\nThe detailing ofan evaluation and accountability \r\nplan to measure both student and s~hool performance \r\nThe Legislature has appropriated 52 million for \r\nthe project. \r\n\r\nMassachusetts \r\n\r\nA more ambitious proposal is in the planning \r\nstages for Massachusetts. By the end of June, the \r\nSpecial Commission on the Conditions ofTeaching, \r\nrepresenting the executive and legislative branches, \r\nadministrator and teacher organizations, as well as \r\nthe ass Â·:iation of state school boards and private \r\nindusu\':\' , ,,\'~tl recommend that the state provide \r\nincentives for school restructuring, In anticipation \r\nof that, staff with the joint House and Senate \r\nCommittee on Education are drafllng legislation \r\nthat would create what House educallon chair \r\nRepresentative Nicholas Paleologos calls 50 to 100 \r\n\"Carnegie schools.\" \r\n\r\nThe House ha~ already approved $20 million for \r\nthe project in which every school in the state will \r\nbe invited to submit a restructuring proposal, Senate \r\neducation chair Richard Kraus is pushong for similar \r\nbudget appropriations from his colleagues, \r\n\r\n\"We want schools in which teachers and \r\nprincipals are empowered beyond anything we\'ve \r\ndreamed in this state or any other state.\" says \r\nPaleologos. \r\n\r\nAs part of the state/school conttact. the state and \r\nco!lective bargaining interests agree to \"back off\' \r\nfrom local, school-building decision making over \r\nsuch issues as curriculum, teacher and slUdent \r\nassignments, textbooks, even the length of the \r\nschool day, forthe duration ofthe three-to-four year \r\nexperiment. \r\n\r\n\"We\'ve got to loosen up those bureaucratic \r\nshackles and introduce changes -not that make \r\nclassrooms more miserable, but more engaging for \r\nstudents and teachers,\" he explains. \"Key people \r\nin Massachusetts are beginning to see the move for \r\nbetter schools as an opportunity to do some interesting \r\nthings th~teducators have always wanted to do,\" \r\n\r\nInitial calls for restructuring Massachusetts \r\npublic schools were not greeted with enthusiasm by \r\nschool administtators. \r\n\r\n\"Principals had seen Carnegie as threatening, \r\nbut the more they get into it the more they realize \r\nthat they are as frusttated as teachers because the \r\n\r\nauthority they have is over\'small things. When it \r\ncomes to the big issues -how to make the schools \r\nrun better for kids -they\'re as powerless as the \r\ntt:achen. They realize that the problems are systemi~ \r\nand that by sharing power, they gain power. They \r\ngain a faculty and staff that are more excited about \r\nwhat they are doing, and they buy in because they \r\nhad a voice in crafting the proposals. Directly and \r\nindirectly, the Carnegie approach will have a \r\nprofound impact on school leadership.\" \r\n\r\nLater this summer, state education officials will \r\nmeet with staff from the federal Northeast regional \r\neducation laboratory to develop a new S$ ofweights \r\nand measures to determine how the restructured \r\nschools compare against those that choose to remain \r\nin the more ttaditional m<><le, \r\n\r\n\"We\'ve got to be bold enough to step back from \r\nthe way we\'ve been doing things for the past 200 \r\nyears and ask ifthat\'s really the best way to organize \r\na school,\" concludes Paleologos. \"We\'ve-got to \r\npose that question to the professionals in the \r\nclassroom. We have a hunch that when we lay the \r\nchallenge down and ask the principals and the \r\nteachers, How would you run this school? we\'ll \r\nreceive a flood of very interesting proposals.\" \r\n\r\nThe CUnton Report on Leadushlp \r\n\r\nArkansas Governor Bill Clinton\'s interest in \r\nleadership as a distinct and essential aspect of \r\neducation reform has been well documented, not \r\nonly in his home srate, but nationally as chairma~ \r\nthis year ofboth the Edu~ationCommission ofthe \r\nStates and the National Governors\' Association. \r\nLast year he chaired the NGA task force on school \r\nleadership and management. offering 10 recommendations \r\nfor state action in Time for Results: The \r\nGovernors\' 1991 Report on &lucation. \r\n\r\nThis year, as outgoing ECS chairman, Clinton \r\nwill deliver a major national address on school \r\nleadership at the ECS National Forum and Annual \r\nMeeting, July 8 through I I in Denver. \r\n\r\nThe annual meeting will also see the release of \r\nhis published report and IS-minute video documentary \r\non instructional leadership. \r\n\r\nThe findings and recommendations presented by \r\nClinton in his report and documentary are different \r\nfrom any other study on leadership to date for \r\nseveral reasons. \' \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nThey represent a new generation of thinking o~ \r\nleadership. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nHis investigation was carried out with one \r\npurpose in mind and one purpose only: How can \r\nleadership make schools better places for learn \r\ning? \r\nâ€¢ \r\nHis work reflects 0,1 a new willingness from \r\nincumbent leadership to redi~tribute the wealth \r\n-the hidden weahh of untapped leadership \r\npotential, \r\nInformation about the ECS annual meeting and \r\nthe Clinto\" report on leadership is available from \r\nECS Communications, 1860 Lincoln Stteet, Suite \r\n300, Denver, Colorado 80295-0301, \r\n\r\nE.

But little has changed \r\nin the way ~I:hools operate -huw time \r\nis spent. how decisions are made. how \r\nprofessional educators relate to each \r\nother and to their charges. A tew notable \r\nexceptions to this rule exist. but \r\nthese exceptions are otten of a marginal \r\nnature and have little effect on instructional \r\npractice or edul:ational outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe Carnegie proposab that have \r\ncaptured the spotlight share a common \r\nproperty with the tirst wave of education \r\nreflo)rms that have swept across the \r\nUnited States: they exert their major effect. \r\non .school inputs. If the nation is to \r\nreap the full benefit of such changes. \r\nhowever. things will have to change illside \r\nthe school. For it is fundamental \r\nchange in the internal life of the school \r\nthat holds the greatest promise for transforming \r\nteaching into a rewarding and \r\nattractive career and creating learning \r\nenvironments that promise to provide \r\nstudents with the capaCity for mdependent \r\nthought and action. \r\n\r\nWhy is this so? Because the current \r\n!ltructure and organization of schooling \r\nnot only make extraordinarily inefticient \r\nuse of those able teachers we are \r\nlucky enough to attract to and retain in \r\nthe schools. but they also create a host \r\nof dbincentives that drive many of our \r\nbe~t teachers out of the schools. \r\n\r\nThis dilerruna can be seen most starkly \r\nin the undifferentiated stamng model \r\nthat characterizes most schools. The \r\nroles. responsibilities. and expectations \r\nthat the school holds for rookie teachers \r\nare no different from those it holds for \r\nexperienced master teachers who know \r\nwhat will engage students and what will \r\nfrustrate them. who know how to help \r\n\r\nstudents over the humps. who kn0\'f \r\nhow to diagnose the learning problems \r\nthat make bright children appear slow to \r\nthe novice teacher. and on and on. \r\n\r\nlt is immensely wasteful to assign \r\nidentical responsibilities to two teachers \r\nof very different capacities. and it is \r\ncounterproductive from the standpoint \r\nof personnel management. as well. The \r\nintluence of the experienced teacher on \r\nthe \'school is no greater than that of the \r\nnovice: and the capable novice. unlike \r\nbeginning professionals in other fields. \r\ncannot look forward to increasing responsibility \r\nthat matches corresponding \r\nincreases in capacity arid performance. \r\n\r\nOf course. it doesn\'t have to be this \r\nway. and. at the .margins. some schools \r\nare beginning to experimerlt with differentiated \r\nstafting schemes. These are \r\nusually confined to senior staff members \r\nserving as mentors for junior staff \r\nmembers and very little else. What is \r\nabsent is what is typically found in the \r\npractice of other professions: the roles \r\nof prufes~ionals are sharply di!.tinguished \r\nby virtue of their expertise. \r\nresponsibilit). and productivity; their \r\nstatu!> and compensation are likewise \r\ndifferentiated. \r\n\r\nContrast the life of teachers with that \r\nof accountants. attorneys. or architects \r\nwho practice their craft in a protessional \r\npartnership. In the case of accountants. \r\nattorneys. and architects. real rewards \r\nin status. remuneration. and responsibility \r\ndepend on acquiring national certitlcation. \r\nTeaching has no national assessment \r\nworthy of !.uch recognition. \r\nSuccessfully I.:ompleting assignments. \r\ncases. or projects for clients not only \r\ntranslates into increased earning power \r\nfor most professionals but in time leads \r\nto greater responsibility and more challenging \r\nclients. In teaching we reward \r\ntime in the seat and the aC4uisition of \r\n\r\n\r\n[1 J \r\n\r\ngraduate credit irrespective of whether \r\nanything is learned -much less applied \r\nin a manner that is beneticial to children. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe professional practice model \r\nwnrks hecause -unlike teachers -accountants. \r\nattornevs. and architects continue \r\nto practice their trade even as they \r\ngain experience and assume greater rer \r\n1 sponsibility. It seems that such an obvious \r\nprogression in the life of a professional \r\nwould not he worth noting. until \r\none realizes that a teacher\'s career does \r\nnot fit this mold. As a result. there IS \r\ntremendous satisfaction among those in \r\nother professions as they move up in \r\nthe organization. and. consequently. the \r\n\r\n\\ J \r\n\r\nr ~ \r\n\r\nhest practitioners generally choose to\r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nstay in their profession. \r\n\r\nI\r\nI\r\nT IS NOT just better salaries that \r\nhold the best people in a profession. \r\nThey also take responsibility and \r\nmanage the toughest and most challenging \r\ncases both hecause these are the \r\nassignments that promise to yield the \r\ngreatest returns for their firm and be\r\n\r\n\r\nI 1 \r\n\r\ncause they are marks of status and acl \r\ncomplishment. Such people are provid\r\n\r\n\r\nJ \r\n\r\ned enough support staff and facilities to \r\ninsure that their time is spent in the most \r\n\r\nr \' \r\n\r\nprodu<.:tive \r\nmanner possible. Tasks that \r\n\r\nt ] \r\ncan be done bv those with little experience \r\nor expertise are routinely \r\nfarmed nut to junior professionals or to \r\ntechnical and clerical personnel. The \r\n\r\n, j \r\n\r\ntasks of administration are often delegated \r\ntn a nonprofessional. and life is \r\narranged so as not to distance senior \r\npartners from their clients but to keep \r\n\r\n\\ , them engaged to the fullest in their \r\npractice. \r\nThe Carnegie Task Force believed \r\nthat there was much in the professional \r\n\r\nl j \r\npractice model that commended itself to \r\nthe schools and that could be adapted to \r\ngreat effect. A Nation Prepared. there\r\n\r\n\r\n\\ , \r\nfore. called for a more diverse staffing \r\nstructure for the schools. one that \r\nis designed to capitalize on the knowledge. \r\nskill. and accumulated wisdom of \r\nour most able teachers. Such a staffing \r\nstructure would be headed by \"Iead \r\nteachers\" -ideally. those professionals \r\nwho held advanced certificates from the \r\nNational Certification Board and who. \r\nafter a number of years in practice. \r\nwere regarded hy their peers as especially \r\nwell-qualified to take on leadership \r\npositions in the school. Lead \r\nteachers would coordinate the work of \r\n\r\n\\. J \r\n\r\nthe school\'s entire instructional staff. \r\n\r\nincluding \r\nthe assignments of other \r\n\r\nteachers. \r\ninstructional specialists. and \r\n\r\ntutors. They would be invested with \r\n\r\nmuch greater responsihility and authori\r\n\r\n\r\nty for students\' learning experiences. \r\n\r\nand they would be held accountable for \r\n\r\nthe performance of the entire school. \r\n\r\nThis plan would involve a trade hetween \r\nteachers -who more often than \r\nnot regard themselves as the victims \r\nrather than the beneficiaries of education \r\nreform -and state and local \r\nauthorities. who must simultaneouslv \r\nguard and promote the public interest. \r\nIn return for offering teachers the responsIbility \r\nand authority befitting true \r\nprofessionals. the state would require \r\nthat lead teachers demonstrate their \r\ncompetence by sitting for the\' National \r\nBoards and that regular and equitable \r\nassessment practices be adopted to \r\nmeasure the performance of the entire \r\nschool as a means of holding lead teachers \r\naccountable. \r\n\r\nFor such a system to work. teachers \r\nwill have to be involved in establishing \r\nthe performance criteria. which would \r\npresumably be much broader than those \r\nto which we have grown accustomed. \r\nThis will be no easy task. but it seems \r\nthat there are few .dternatives. If all the \r\nrhetoric about fOl:IJsing on excellence \r\nand quality is to have any meaning. the \r\nenergies and attention of the\' entire \r\nschool must be directed toward these \r\ngoals. This means aligning the incentive \r\nand reward structure for teachers and \r\nadministrators with the broad directions \r\nand purposes that state and local authorities \r\nset for the schools. \r\n\r\nSuch an alignment would mark a major \r\nchange in policy. for all too often it \r\nis not the pursuit of knowledge but the \r\npursuit of tranquillity that energizes the \r\nschools. Principals are commended and \r\npromoted. and teachers are valued for \r\ntheir capacity to maintain order. At the \r\nsame time. there are no special incentives \r\nfor bringing low-achieving students \r\nup to grade level or for doing \r\nmore than merely insuring that the statemandated \r\ncurriculum is covered. As a \r\nconsequence. we have a system that \r\nencourages principals to hire low-cost \r\nteachers rather than especially effective \r\nteachers. This is not to say that lowsalaried \r\nteachers cannot be highly effective \r\n-just that the emphasis is placed \r\non the wrong factors. often to ill effect. \r\nMoreover. the current system provides \r\nno incentive for the careful allocation \r\n\r\nWe must invest \r\n\r\nteachers with a \r\n\r\nmuch greater degree \r\n\r\nof trust and \r\n\r\nresponsibility to \r\n\r\nrender professional \r\n\r\njudgments about the \r\n\r\nmost appropriateI educational treatments. \r\n\r\nIL-________________________\r\n\r\n~ \r\n\r\nof inservice training funds in ways thal \r\nmight improve teacher productivity and \r\nstudent progress. Fundamentally. our \r\nsystem of schooling provides little motivation \r\nto redirect resources from administration \r\nto instruction. \r\n\r\nReorienting the energy and direction \r\nof the schools will occur only when two \r\nthings happen. First. a rational and fair \r\nincentive structure must be put in place \r\nto direct the attention of the entire \r\nschool toward th; educational outcomes \r\nthat are judged by the state and the community \r\nto be in the public interest. Second. \r\n\\\\c: must invest teachers with a \r\nmuch greater degree of trust and responsibility \r\nto render professional judgments \r\nabout the most appropriate educational \r\ntreatments for their students. By \r\ndoing these things. we could transform \r\nteaching into a career worth pursuing; \r\ninsure that the schools become much \r\nmore productive and engaging places in \r\nwhich to work. and. most important. direct \r\nthe energy and attention of professional \r\neducators toward mobilizing all \r\navailable resources to produce the \r\ngreatest possible gains for all students. \r\n\r\nE\r\nE\r\nARLIER generations saw work \r\nas no more than a means of putting \r\nbread on the table. However. \r\ntoday\'s young people are \r\nnot only looking for jobs with decent \r\nfinancial rewards: they are also looking \r\nfor jobs in which they can make their \r\npresence felt. in which they can contribute \r\nto the success of the enterprise. \r\nand in which they can use their imagination. \r\ncreativity. and analytic capacity. \r\nJudged according to these terms. teaching \r\nis not now a career that is very satisfying. \r\nBut it could become so. . \r\n\r\nThe secret is to provide teachers with \r\nmuch greater discretion than they now \r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 1986 \r\n\r\n\r\nIn \r\nl J \r\n_ \r\n\r\np \r\n\r\n\r\n, j \r\n\r\n-f \'\\ \r\n\r\nI \r\nl J \r\n\r\nr \' \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\n, , \r\n\r\n\\ , \r\n\r\n\\ J \r\n\r\n\\ , \r\n\r\n, , \r\n\r\ntil make thelllsl\'ht\'\\ di!!lbk (llr a pnl \r\n\r\ndUl\'tlvJtv nllnus.

In such schools, prin\r\n\r\n\r\ncipals would be leaders as well as prin\r\n\r\n\r\ncipal teachcrs. \r\n\r\n* * * * * * * \r\n\r\nIf teachers were to be given such discretion, \r\nthen establishing a rational \r\nmodel of accountability would provide \r\nthose entrusted with the public interest \r\nwith some greater assurance that teachers\' \r\nenergies would be turned in the appropriate \r\ndirection. At the same time, \r\nfor state and local authorities it would \r\nmean abandoning a set of prescriptive \r\nmeasures that contine professional judg-I \r\nment to very narrow bounds in favor of \r\nmuch greater clarity about the goals of \r\neducation. \r\n\r\nSuch a change is likely to be healthy \r\nfor both parties. A professional environment \r\nfor teachers would be created \r\nthat would enable the schools to compete \r\nwith greater success for. especially \r\nable people in a much more open labor \r\nmarket than thev have ever confronted \r\nbefore. At the same time. refocusing the \r\nattention of officials on the ends of education \r\nwould not only move the authorities \r\naway from the deadening activity of \r\ntrying to tighten the screws on the system \r\n(an exercise that appears to be mo\\\'ing \r\nus toward political gridlock), but \r\nwould also draw their attention toward \r\nthe larger questions with which they \r\nought to be grappling. \r\n\r\nWe do not believe that there is one \r\nbest wav to restructure the schools. But \r\na number of principles that we have \r\ntouched on above deserve attention. \r\n\r\nA central idea in the restructuring that \r\nwe propose is a break with the ~eggcrate\" \r\nschool. in which teachers are \r\nisolated. In this antiquated model. students \r\nwho are fortunate enough to come \r\ninto contact with a great teacher have \r\nthe benetit of that teacher\'s knowledge \r\nand skill. but no one else does -not the \r\nother students in the school and not the \r\nother teachers. This is a huge waste of \r\ntalent of a sort that most professional \r\npartnerships would not tolerate. Ignoring \r\ndifferences of skill and capacity inevitably \r\nmeans that real talent goes unrewarded \r\nand that too much is asked of \r\nthe neophyte. Because appropriate rewards \r\nare denied to the most skilled. \r\nprevailing inccntives drive many such \r\npeople out of teaching but are sufficient \r\nto keep in teaching people .... ho perceive \r\n\r\ncommand, to treat them as professionals, \r\nto recognize that the best teaching is \r\ncustom tailored by a constant process of \r\nfeedback, analysis, and judgment ahout \r\nstudent progress and understanding. \r\nThis can only happen when teachers \r\nhave the freedom to organize the school \r\nday and the school\'s resources in ways \r\nthat best suit the immediate educational \r\nneeds of their students. \r\n\r\nYet we structure our schools as if we \r\nhad no need for the sort of flexibility \r\nthat such an environment demands. Assuming \r\nthat we already had a system \r\nthat assured administrators and school \r\nboards that teachers met high pro\r\n\r\n\r\nfessional standards of competence, \r\nwouldn\'t it make sense to allow practitioners \r\nto exercise professional judgment \r\nin allocating the school\'s resources \r\nand to provide them with a much greater \r\nvoice in operating these local institutions \r\n-not unlike the role played by \r\nother professionals in marshaling the \r\nknowledge and expertise of their partnership \r\nto meet the needs of their \r\nclients? \r\n\r\n* * * * * * * \r\n\r\nImagine what such a school might \r\nlook like. Groups of teachers would \r\ngather periodically to determine how \r\nbest to cluster and distribute among the \r\nstaff those students for whom they were \r\nrespc;msible. Class times and sizes might \r\nbe varied across the school day, and \r\nteachers might not be confined to a single \r\nclassroom. Students as well as \r\nteachers might be encouraged to move \r\nabout -the former to master an assigned \r\nlesson or to search for an engag\r\n\r\n\r\ning learlling experience, the latter to \r\nconsult with a colleague or to monJlor a \r\nparticular group of studentc; in need of \r\nperiodic oversight. \r\n\r\nTeachers who were especially adept \r\nat helping students who were having \r\ntrouble with a particular subject would \r\nbe so acknowledged and would be made \r\naccessible to all students. Similarly, \r\nsome schools might designate student \r\ntutors for this role or even a scientist on \r\nloan for a few days from a local firm. \r\n\r\nEarly in the school year, those teachers \r\nwith lead responsibilities might meet \r\nto distribute their school\'s discretionary \r\nbudget. That budget would be larger \r\nthan in times past because, with key instructional \r\ndecisions pushed down to the \r\nbuilding level. there would be less need \r\nfor a large central administrative staff to \r\nmake decisions and issue orders that \r\nwould now be the province of the individual \r\nschool. \r\n\r\nThe principal, who might at first have \r\nbeen anxious about sharing authority \r\nwith the teachers, would come to appreciate \r\nthe new arrangements once he \r\nor she realized that this was no zerosum \r\ngame. Because decisions are made \r\nat the school level, principals would \r\nhave much more power than before: because \r\nteachers are fully involved in decision \r\nmaking, the principal\'s decisions \r\nwould be much more likely to be carried \r\nout as intended. \r\n\r\nLeadership would be far more rewarding \r\nin schools in which the entire \r\nstaff worked toward a common goal: \r\nhelping students to achieve at much \r\nhigher levels than ever before in order \r\n\r\n1\'\r\n\r\n\r\ni\' \r\n\r\nI,: __ 1.-.. : \".-.. .,..-;... ___ ...-_ --.. ~,.-.... _,.....--...-...-....--.. ...-... _ --. \r\n\r\n--.. ~ -.. --.. ~::: ::.::: :::.--.-.---::-..::::-~,.-\"\\..-~~---\r\n\r\n\r\n---.. ---.. -.....-..-\r\n\r\n\r\n...--.---....-.....-..\".--......----~8~ \r\n\r\nÂ¥/\'m here to address you aboUlthe pressing shonage ofstudent parking. \r\n\r\n26 \r\n\r\nPHI DELTA KAPPAN \r\n\r\n\r\n[1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves as having les~ \'appealing alternatives \r\nelsewhere. \r\n\r\nThe Carnegie Forum Task Force proposed \r\nthe creation of a career progression \r\nfor teachers that would culminate \r\nin a lead teacher position. This proposal \r\nis not designed to generate a new stratum \r\nof assistant principals but to find \r\nways of making the skill. wisdom. and \r\nknowledge of the school\'s best teachers \r\navailable both to the principal and to \r\nother teachers. \r\n\r\nLead teachers would play a key role \r\nin setting a school\'s instructional policy \r\nand in involving other teachers in \r\nthe decisions that affect instructional \r\npolicy. Lead teachers would continue to \r\nteach. but they would also work with\r\n\r\n-p \r\n\r\nother teachers. provide direct super\r\n\r\n\r\nl ) \r\nvision to new instructors not vet fully \r\nlicensed by the state to teach. train \r\nstudent tutors. head curriculum revi\r\n\r\n\r\nr0 \r\n\r\nsion teams. serve as consultants to otherl J teachers in their areas of specialization. \r\nand analyze the sources of probr \r\n\' lems faced by students with unusuallyl perplexing learning difficulties. Lead \r\nteachers would work to find ways to \r\nshare their own insights and the creative \r\nr \' approaches of other teachers and to elici \r\nl j it the insights of their colleagues. They \r\nwould play the key role in the school of \r\ninvolving all teachers in a collective effort \r\nto analyze the school\'s performance \r\ni and to find ways of improving it. They\r\n\r\n, J \r\n\r\nwould devote themselves to creating \r\nthe kind of collegial environment that \r\nI teachers say they want but rarely find. \r\nl j This proposal is not intended to provide \r\nmanagement without leadership. \r\nas some seem to have interpreted the \r\nsuggestion that a committee of lead \r\nteachers might govern the school. The \r\nexisting model of the nonteaching principal \r\nmight work perfectly well in \r\nbringing about the kind of school envi\r\n\r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nsioned here. But like a professional \r\npartnership. which is overseen by a \r\ncommittee of senior partners and \r\nchaired by a managing partner. so the \r\nschool might have a ~managing~ teacher \r\nor ~principal\" teacher and return us to \r\nthe original conception of the principal \r\nas instructional leader. \r\n\r\nOther models of leadership might also \r\nwork. depending on the skills. talents. \r\nand interests of those who take responsi\r\n\r\n\r\n, ! \r\nbi ity for the instructional leadership of \r\nthe school. It is essential. though. not to \r\nbe led astray in the quest for the unassaitably \r\nperfect model of leadership. but \r\ninstead to find ways to tap and reward \r\n\r\n\\ I \r\n\r\nthe kMwledge and talent that already \r\n\r\nexist in our teaching force (and that are \r\n\r\ndeparting \r\nfrom it at an alarminl! rate). \r\n\r\nAt the same time. new structures \r\nof compensation should be developed \r\nthat are connected to the new staffing \r\nstructure. This would mean providing \r\nsignificant pay differentials to teachers \r\nwith greater responsibilities and to \r\nteachers who demonstrate their competence \r\nby receiving certification from the \r\nNational Board. Seniority would also \r\ndeserve to be recognized in teacher salary \r\nscales. but the accumulation of educational \r\ncredits would not. This provision \r\nis not meant to discourage the continuing \r\neducation of teachers but to emphasize \r\nthose kinds of continuing education \r\nthat translate into increased capacity. \r\nas represented by National Board assessments \r\nand by expanded responsibility. \r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a compensation structure. \r\npegged at levels that are competitive \r\nwith other occupations that demand a \r\ncollege degree. would provide teachers \r\nWIth real prospects for personal growth \r\nand reward over the long term. This \r\nwould stand in sharp contrast to current \r\npractice. which typically elevates \r\nteachers to a fairly low plateau after \r\n10 or 12 years and holds no prospect \r\nfor advancement. save through leaving \r\nteaching for an administrative position. \r\n\r\nT\r\nT\r\nHE PROPOSALS of the Carnegie \r\nTask Force are made at a \r\ntime of true crisis in U. S. \r\nschools. Demand for teachers \r\nis rising fast. and supply shows no sign \r\nof following that demand. If we were \r\nspeaking of medicine. architecture. or \r\naccounting. then the economists would \r\ntell us that professional salaries in the \r\naffected field would rise until the supply \r\nof applicants willing to work at the \r\nhigher salaries matched the demand. \r\nUnfortunately. in education we do \r\nthings differently. We lower the qualifications \r\nfor entrance to the field until \r\nthere are enough people available who \r\nwill work at the unchanged salary. \r\n\r\nIf. this time around. we settle for any \r\nwarm body who will teach. we will be \r\nin grave trouble for two reasons. First. \r\ncollege-educated men and women have \r\na much wider range of careers open to \r\nthem than ever before. so the pool of \r\nable college graduates available for \r\nteaching careers at the prevailing salaries \r\nis much smaller than it was in the \r\n\r\nUSED \'-lITH PERHISSION \r\n\r\nLead teachers \r\n\r\nwould play a key \r\n\r\nrole in setting the \r\n\r\ninstructional policy \r\n\r\nof a school and \'in \r\n\r\ninvolving other \r\n\r\nteachers in decisions \r\nthat affect \r\ninstructional policy. \r\n\r\n\\ i \r\nJ \r\n\r\npast. Second. the highly technical nature \r\nof the world economy makes it imperative \r\nthat we produc~ high school \r\ngraduates who are far better educated\' \r\nthan ever before. The performance of \r\nthe entire elementary and secondary \r\nsystem of schooling must be radically \r\nupgraded at the very time that we \r\nare experiencing a severe shortage of \r\nteachers. That is the nature of the crisis \r\nwe face. \r\n\r\nWhen placed against both the demographic \r\nchallenges that confront us and \r\nthe need to develop greater capacity in \r\nstudents by the time they graduate from \r\nhigh school. the .case for structural reform \r\nbecomes all the more compelling. \r\nIf the education that was once reserved \r\nfor an elite is now to be provided for all \r\n(or nearly all). then we have a productivity \r\npro~lem of major proportions. if \r\nwe are not to bankrupt the country in \r\nllur search for educational excellence. \r\n\r\nEven if tinancing were not a consideration. \r\nwe would stili be forced to restructure \r\nthe schools SImply because the \r\nschools will get no more than their fair \r\nshare of the best and the brightest college \r\ngraduates. Teachers are obviously \r\nthe most important resource in the \r\neducational lives of our -:htldren.

Yet we face a growing \r\nteacher shortage, a shortage exacerbated by the attractiveness \r\nof other career opportunities for college educated \r\npeople. \r\n\r\nRecent years have seen a dramatic improvement in the career \r\nopportunities available to college educated women. So. too. \r\nfor minorities. \r\n\r\nIt is hardly surprising that, as careers in many professions \r\nopen to well educated women, many fewer elect teaching. \r\nAnd. just as the percentage of minority children is rising. the \r\npercentage of new teachers from minority groups is falling. \r\n\r\nIf we continue as we are today. school districts will lower \r\nstandards, states will issue temporary licenses. and growing \r\nnumbers of teachers will teach out of subject. \r\n\r\nThe best teachers now in the schools will be increasingly \r\ndispirited and will leave in increasing numbers. and the more \r\n\r\n( \r\nacademically accomplished students entering college will vote \r\nwith their feet to avoid teaching. \r\n\r\nThe quality of education offered our children will decline at \r\nan accelerating rate, and the ranks of teachers will be filled \r\nby drawing on an ever larger fraction of the least qualified \r\ncandidates from the pool of applicants. \r\n\r\nBut we will only be deceiving ourselves if communities succeed \r\nin populating their classrooms with adults who go \r\nthrough the motions but are not effecth\'e teachers. \r\n\r\nThe only way to attract a sufficient number of qualified people \r\ninto teaching is to alter the professional environment in \r\nthe schools to make a teaching career attractive, and to open \r\nentry into the profession to all college arts and sciences \r\ngraduates. \r\n\r\nOur strategy is admittedly bold. but it can work. We would \r\nbegin by: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Raising the standards for teachers. \r\nâ€¢ Strengthening their educational preparation. \r\nâ€¢ Revamping their compensation system. \r\nâ€¢ Restructuring the schools to make teaching more effective. \r\nproductive and rewarding. \r\nâ€¢ Encouraging communities to set goals for school performance. \r\nto which teachers can commit themselves. and fM \r\nwhich they are willing to be held accountable. \r\nâ€¢ ~lobilizing the nation\'s resources to prepare minority \r\nyoungsters for teaching careers. \r\nWe propose that a ;-Iational Board for Professional Teaching \r\nStandards be created to est;lblish and maintain high standards \r\nfor teaching. It would develop new methods of assessment, \r\nboth for suhject matter competence and the demonstrated \r\nability to teach. \r\n\r\nI\r\nThe Board \\\\\'ould issue certificates attesting to two levels of \r\ncompetence ..\\ majority of the Board would be elected by \r\nother teachers who have alreadv been Board-certified. \r\nTeachers \\\\\'()uld seek Board certification voluntarily: licensure \r\n\\\\\'ould continue to be the responsibility of the states. \r\n\r\n(\r\n\r\nBut we believe that school hoards \\\\\'ill be eager to recognize \r\nthe \\\'alue lit Board-certified teachers in their recruiting, and \r\nteachers \\\\Â·ill be eager to achie\\\'e this objective recognition of \r\n\r\n\" \r\n\r\n\r\ntheir profes.slunal competence. \r\n\r\nRestructuril1~ of the schools is needed to make the best use \r\nof those \\\\Â·cLl qualified. certified teachers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe envision two levels of responsibility within the school \r\n\r\nfaculty: teachers and lead teachers. \r\n\r\nSupporting them would be a variety of other staff, inclucing \r\ninstructors with subject matter competence but requiring \r\nsupervision, a variety of technical and administrative staff, \r\n\r\nand student tutors. \r\n\r\nIt makes little sense to staff all the tasks in a school with people \r\nof identical responsibility. Yet this is the pattern in our \r\nschools todav. Restructuring would enable schools to make \r\nmuch more efficient use of a very important resourceteaching \r\nprofessionals. \r\n\r\nIf, in addition, teachers are encouraged to work together in a \r\ncollegial manner, making creative use of all the resources in \r\nthe school in the best interest of all the students, it is verv \r\nlikely they would begin to break away from the traditional \r\nclassroom compartmentalization of the school and the isolation \r\nof teachers from one another. \r\n\r\nFinally, professional teachers, working within a context of \r\nclear goals for students set by the state and the district. \r\nshould have a much greater voice in deciding how those \r\ngoals are to be met. If professional teachers, who meet high \r\nstandards, are allowed to work like professionals, they are \r\nmore likely to deliver the quality of education of which they. \r\nand their support staff, are capable. \r\n\r\nIf we expect a lot more from the professional teacher, we \r\nmust provide a lot stronger educational system to educate \r\nour teachers. \r\n\r\nWe recommend phasing out the undergraduate baccalaureate \r\ndegree in education, requiring instead that all teachers-\'including \r\nthose who teach elementary school-have an arts \r\nand sciences baccalaureate. \r\n\r\nAMaster in Teaching degree would be introduced, with a \r\nstrong focus on learning how to teach in real life situations. \r\nInternship and supervised residency conducted in participating \r\nlocal public schools are the core of this concept. \r\n\r\n~ \r\nÂ§ \r\n...... \r\nC \r\n(j \r\nrnder this arrangement, any college graduate in arts and \r\nsciences-including mature people in other industries interested \r\nin taking up teaching-could take the ~laster in \r\nTeaching program or enter teaching by an apprO\\\'ed \r\nalternate path. \r\n\r\nThe potential pool of well educated people for future \r\nteachers would be greatly expanded. \r\n\r\nEven so. higher standards. a professional enrironment for \r\nteaching, and stronger education for teachers will not attract \r\nto teaching careers the more than 200.000 college graduates \r\nneeded per year by 1992 unless the compensation system for \r\nteachers is restructured tOo. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe fa\\\"Of abolishing the current system of paying teachers \r\nmore for taking continuing education courses. and instead \r\nhasing compensation on four elements: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Level of Board certification attained. ~ \r\n-~ := \r\n-<\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Le\\\'e1 of responsibility in the school. \r\n~ \r\n\r\n~ \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Experience (or seniority). -0 \r\n\"\" \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Performance of the students in the entire school against :d \r\n~ \r\n\r\nagreed objectives. := \r\n\r\n~ \r\n\r\n\";t\r\n\r\nThe pay scale that reflects these elements must have an ade0 \r\nquate starting salarv and will have to rise, on the average. ~ \r\nSalary range. from top to bottom, would also be increased \r\nsubstantially to retlect the same four elements. \r\n\r\nTo attract able college graduates to teaching. they will have \r\nto be paid competitively with other careers requiring a comparable \r\neducation-accountants. for example. \r\n\r\nTeachers also need ()pp()rtunities tilr career ad\\\'ancement \r\nwhen their professional attainment and job responsibilities \r\njustify it. \r\n\r\nTodar\'s teachers \'tor ,)ut\' in salary after In or 12 years. except \r\nfor annual cost (It\' li\\\'ing raises. \'\\0 wonder that half the \r\npeople who enter tead1ing lean: by their seventh year. \r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n4 \r\n\r\n\\,I.J \r\n\r\nH: \r\nliJ\' \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\n\r\nClearly. if higher performance is expected of teachers, there \r\n\r\nmust be incentives that justify their commitment. and they. \r\n\r\nin turn must accept accountability for the achic\\Â·eme.nt of \r\nagreed upon goals. \r\n\r\nThis is what we mean by the performanceÂ·based element of \r\ncompensation. \r\n\r\nWe visualize a school district discussing \\\\\'ith the community. \r\nand with the educational leaders in the community\'s schools. \r\nthe potential for progress of all the students in each school. \r\nEach year\'s goals are agreed to by the teachers. who are \r\nrewarded collectively if the goal is overachieved. \r\nOur schools have very little experience with such incentive \r\nsystems; a great deal of discu~sion with teachers and school \r\nofficials will no doubt be required to find satisfactory \r\nmethods. \r\n\r\nBut citizens in the community must be able to measure \r\nwhether their investments in reform are producing the \r\ndesired results. \r\n\r\nTeachers should have incentives !O \\\\\'ork together creatively \r\nto address the needs of all the children in the school. \r\n\r\nFinally, it must be said that the most serious challenge may \r\nbe to make sure that the teaching force is broadly represenÂ· \r\ntative of the whole population while higher standards are \r\nimposed. \r\n\r\n:--Jo one-especially no minority parent-would want differenÂ· \r\ntial standards. with minoritr teachers held to a lower stanÂ· \r\ndard. ~Iinoritv children-in\'deed all children-need the very \r\n6est teachers: representing all races and ethnic backgrounds \r\nin America. \r\n\r\nHigher standards are most important to insure that those \r\nchildren from poor families are given every chance to break \r\nout of the cycle of poverty. But to insure their motivation \r\nand self confidence. these children must encounter teachers \r\nfrom their own background from time to time. \r\n\r\nImproving the compensation system for all teachers and making \r\ntheir work more attractive will. of course. equally attract \r\nminority as well as white teachers. \r\n\r\nBut so many minority students are lost from leaks in the \r\neducational pipeline. that the pool of minority college \r\ngraduates is too small to provide teachers in numbers \r\nanywhere near approaching the mix of the student\\ \r\n\r\nIn this area. partnerships of communityÂ·based organizations. \r\nbusinesses. higher education institutions and schools fund(:d \r\nfrom state and federal sources will have to address the educaÂ· \r\ntion of disadvantaged students starting at precollege lerels. in \r\norder to produce more minority teachers. \r\n\r\nThe program juSt described will be expensive. So too will \r\ncontinuing on present course and speed. \r\n\r\nBut there is every reason to believe that these reforms will \r\nincrease the productivity of the most qualified teachers. and \r\nwill eventually reduce the cost of teacher education by \r\nreducing teacher turno\\Â·er. \r\n\r\nSubstantial savings in other sectors would also follow-for \r\nexample. by reducing the need for remedial courses in the \r\nfreshman year of college. \r\n\r\nBut. if communities want these kinds of schools. additional \r\nim\'estment will be needed. \r\n\r\nFortunately. we estimate the total cost. if spread over a ten . \r\nyear period. could be met by increasing public school investÂ· \r\nments at the same rate of growth as the economy as a whole. \r\n\r\nt \r\n\r\n\\\\,ill .\\mericans make this im\'estment\' \r\n\r\nÂ§ \r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nI believe they \\\\Â·ill. once they understand what is at stake.

Yes, and this one\'s a blockbuster. \r\n\r\n\"Who Will Teach our Children?: A Strategy for Improving California\'s \r\nSchools\" is the report of the California Commission on the \r\nTeaching Profession. The commission was appointed by three public \r\nofficials-the chairs of the Senate and Assembly EdJ.lcation Committees \r\nand the State Commissioner of Public Instruction~acting in their private \r\ncapacities. The commission was funded privately by the Hewlett \r\nFoundation. While it dealt specifically with California, the problems \r\nthe commission addressed and the solutions it recommends have clear \r\n\r\nnational significance. \r\n\r\nIn the last few years states have passed laws and issued regulations \r\nrequiring students to take math, English, science, social studies. In \r\nmany states students can\'t graduate without passing competency tests \r\nin these areas. But it\'s easier to pass laws and issue regulations than to \r\nimplement them. How will the students master these subjects unless \r\nthere are teachers who can teach them? The warning signals are everywhere. \r\nIn spite of talk about tougher and higher standards, more and \r\nmore uncertified and unqualified teachers are being hired across the \r\ncountry. New York City has employed 13,000 teachers who haven\'t \r\nmet the minimum standards. Baltimore schools gave a test to prospec\r\n\r\n\r\ntive teachers, then hired those who failed the examination, because \r\nthere were more job openings than applicants who passed. Tens of \r\nthousands of classes are taught by misassigned teachers-teachers qualified \r\nin one subject teaching a different subject in which they are not \r\n\r\nqualified.\r\n\r\nI have traveled across the country over the last two years attending \r\nconferences on the question of how we can attract and retain qualified \r\nteachers. I haven\'t heard of any similar conferences on how to attract \r\nand retain qualified doctors, dentists, engineers or lawyers. In each of \r\nthese and other fields it\'s understood that ours is a free market economy. \r\nShortages are not remedied by holding conferences but by improving \r\nincentives. Of course, the reason for all these conferences on \r\nhow to attract and retain qualified teachers is that there\'s a desire to do \r\nit without changing current incentives, and that just can\'t be done. \r\n\r\nUnless there are major changes schools across the country will \r\nemploy more. and Qlore teachers who cannot pass minimum competency \r\ntests themselves. Once hired, such teachers will have to be carefully \r\nwatched and supervised. thus making the job even less attractive \r\nto the competent. All the hope for reforms and improvements will go \r\n\r\ndown the drain. \r\n\r\n~---; ~~ ~ \r\n\r\n~ :... =:J\r\n\r\n~__ L~ ~ ~ \r\n\r\n..J\r\n\r\n.:.J..l \r\n\r\nThe California Commission report is revolutionary. While it calls \r\nfor major improvements in teacher salaries and working conditions. it \r\ngoes far beyond: It calls for turning teaching into a true profession by \r\nmaking it self-governing in the same way other professions are. It \r\nwould create a California Teaching Standards Board, with a majority \r\nof teachers, which would establish standards for entry and advancement \r\nin the profession, develop a code of etlrlcs for the teaching profession \r\nand establish requirements for creating new categories of \r\nteachers such as mentors. peer evaluators and staff developers as part \r\nof a career ladder plan. It would also establish standards for suspending \r\nor revoking teaching credentials. In addition\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ It calls for a radical alteration of teacher preparation andÂ· \r\ntraining by reqUiring all teachers to have a four-year liberal arts education \r\nwith subject matter majors and minors. followed by a year of \r\ngraduate study in professional education and a one-year residency. \r\nâ€¢ It creates a \"board-certified\" classification, so that teachers \r\nwith added study and outstanding demonstrated skills can gain recognition \r\nand earn more on the basis of objective statewide procedures. \r\nâ€¢ Teachers would get full salary credit if they moved from one \r\ndistrict to another, giving them the same opportunity as other professionals-\r\nor anyone else-to move within a career from one location to \r\nanother. â€¢ \r\nâ€¢ It calls on the legislature and school boards to establish a widespread \r\nsystem of sabbaticals. \r\nThe report restructures the teaching career, since under the plan \r\nteachers would not only perform their usual classroom functions but \r\nwould also help train new teachers and have sufficient time to conduct \r\nresearch and to share ideas with colleagues. Teachers would not \r\nbe mere hired hands doing what they\'re told by supervisors. They\'d be \r\nmore like senior partners in a law firm. In a recommendation on how \r\nto \"involve teachers in school decision-making,\" the commission said \r\nteachers should be involved in \"a range of responsibilities,\" -including \r\nselection of new teachers, evaluation of teachers\' performance, helping \r\nestablish goals for the school, development and coordination\' of CJ.lfriculum \r\nacross grade levels and withinÂ· departments, design and conduct \r\nof inservice education at the school Site, and the organization of \r\nthe school for effective instruction, among other items, \r\n\r\n\r\nAnother major .change called for is that schools would be required \r\nto publish an index to inform the public at least every two years of. the \r\nconditions for learning and teaching in every school in the state. \r\nAmong the items that would be reported on in such an index, the \r\ncommission said. should be \"class size, teacher assignments outside theÂ· \r\narea of competence, time spent by teachers on non-teaching tasks, \r\navailability of qualified personnel to provide counseling and other \r\nspecial services for students, availability of well qualified, adequately \r\ncompensated SUbstitutes\" and \"teachers\' assessment. of the quality of \r\nschool leadership,\" among other items. \r\n\r\n. Other major aspects of this revolutionary document will be covered \r\nin a subsequent column. The California commission had the \r\n\r\nÂ·courage to state that there\'s a high pricetag for what it recommends, \r\nbut it believes that the alternative-failing to educate youngsters well or \r\neven adequately because the state has not been able to attract and keep \r\ngood teachers-will be even more costly in the lortg run. What is true \r\nin California is also true for the rest of the country. \r\n\r\nMr. ShiRker\'s comments appear in this ~Â·ecti;nÂ·;v~;;-sUnd-;y. ~nder th~ ;usp~~s of the Unite\"cS Fide-ration of TIICh.rs, ) \r\nthe Ne.

The assessment identified deeply-rooted problems of student achievement, manifest in excessively high failure rates in core academic courses, low Regents placement and graduation rates, disproportionately high rates of suspension, local program placement and Special Education placement among minority students, and severe problems of ~chievement, attendance and behavior at the early secondary grades --leading to a disturbing rate of student loss before graduation, and a low percentage of graduates advancing to college. \r\nThe assessment led to discussions in which the school community struggled to clarify the causes of performance problems and to propose solutions. During these discussions, staff and community acknowledged that student achievement \r\n\\ 	problems perSisted in part because the school system had not accepted responsiâ€¢\r\n/ 	bi1ity for each student, regardless of academic readiness, aptitude, background and motivation. Linked to this absence of shared responsibility for the educaâ€¢tion of the city1s children was the school system1s failure to demonstrate a capacity for collective action, a systemwide collaboration that would enable the District to direct energy to the root causes of student failure. \r\nIn response to the needs assessment, the Superintendent outlined and the Board of Education endorsed a series of beliefs that should characterize the work of the Rochester schools. These beliefs contend that all students can learn, regardless of socio-economic background or pre-school experience, and that schools have the capacity to counteract disadvantage. The beliefs also acknowâ€¢ledge the importance of the relationship between teacher and student, and point to the responsibilities that student, teacher, administrator, parent and community member hold in creating successful schools. In the context of this statement of mission, the Board then directed the Superintendent to design a program that would change the structure of the school system on behalf of improved achievement: change in attitudes, roles, focus of authority, allocation of resources, and methodologies. \r\n( \\ \r\n.() \r\nThe Structure of Change \r\nThe Superintendent\'s plan for change sets two goals for the City School District: improved student performance, and development of an accountable school system. These goals are defined as follows: \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nImproved student performance: higher levels of student achievement, at individual schools and districtwide, that cut across socio-economic lines and ethnic distinctions. Course failure rates, grade retentions, Special Education placements, and suspension rates that disproporâ€¢tionately include minority students and students from lower-income families are not acceptable in the Rochester schools. Belief in all students\' ability to achieve and \"in the school\'s capacity to support students\' success challenges this type of profile. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nAccountability: the capacity to respond to problems of student performance, whether these are represented in individual students or documented districwide. In order to achieve this capacity, the District must define responsibilities clearly in the context of instruction as the primary work of the school system, and join all roles in an effort to respond to assessments of need. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to meet these goals, the District has entered into an improvement program that emphasizes and supports the individual school\'s capacity to respond to problems of student performance. By increasing authority at the level of the school, the District acknowledges that the largest proportion of its resources and creativity resides in the schools, and that the most important interactions in the system take place daily between teachers and students. In the context. of the District\'s definition of accountability, this means that the work of the schools must become increasingly centered on identification and address of achievement problems, making best use of a collaboration that includes student, teacher, administrator, parent and community member. \r\nRochester\'s program of schoor improvement proceeds within districtwide parameters: standards of student performance, coordination of roles, expectaâ€¢tions for school-based planning, and measurement of progress toward the goals of excellence and equity. Within these parameters, the District encourages variations in the schools\' approaches to improved performance. \r\n( \r\n..~ \r\n) \r\n1988-89 PLANNING REQUIREMENTS \r\nPLANNING PROCESS \r\nThe 1988-89 Guidelines for School-Based Planning outline the elements of the planning process (page 7): \r\n(1) 	ASSESSMENT: Using school and student performance information to improvestudent success. \r\nAnnually, schools are provided with student performance information with which to conduct their assessment, develop goals and evaluate progress toward their goals. Much of the information is included in the District\'s Data Base and School Profiles, which provide a portrait of District and schools in areas such as: \r\nâ€¢ 	Attendance. \r\nf 	Behavior (short-term and long-term suspensions). \r\nâ€¢ \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nStudent performance on the California Achievement Test (CAT) and State tests (PEP, PCT and RCT). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nSeparate item analysis of the CAT, State tests, and District exams for the total school as well as for LEP, Special Education and MAP students. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nDescription of the student population by enrollment, mobility, Chapter 1 services, enrollment in Regents, local and MAP courses, dropout and graduation rates, and handicapped referrals. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nItem analysis and grade distributions of student performance on final examinations in core academic subjects (secondary schools). \r\n\r\n\r\nA sample of the Data Base has been provided as a separate document. \r\n(2) 	GOAL SETTING: Setting goals consistent with needs identified by the school, District priorities, and the District\'s 1988-89 Accountaâ€¢bility Plan. \r\nGoals should be a natural outcome when planning teams interact with a well developed and formatted data base. A goal statement should imply the means of measuring that goal. The goal should be stated in precise language, have realistic outcomes, and be based on sound statistical principles where statistical outcome is implied by the goal. \r\n( \r\n/~ ) \r\nGoals could also be planning goals. For example: a school might set a goal to research introducing better supplemental reading materials, but plan to introduce them in a later year. This goal would be self-reporting when evaluating the results. \r\nEach school\'s 1988-89 improvement .plan will, at the minimum, include goals in the following areas: \r\nElementary Schools \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nAttendance. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nStudent performance in language arts and mathematics, with emphasis on important areas of knowledge such as problemâ€¢solving, comprehension, and written/spoken communication. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nIdentification of and support to \"at-risk\" students. \r\n\r\n\r\nMiddle Schools \r\nAttendance. \r\nâ€¢â€¢ Behavior (reduction of disciplinary referrals and suspensions).Student performance in core academic subjects (English, \r\nâ€¢ \r\nmathematics, science, social studies). Identification of and support to \"at-risk\" students. / â€¢â€¢ Home Base Guidance program and home-school communications. Student participation in extracurricular activities.\r\nâ€¢ \r\nStudent placement in Regents classes (beginning in 1989-90, as a\r\nâ€¢ \r\ngoal 	shared by high schools and middle schools). \r\nHigh 	Schools \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nAttendance. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nBehavior (reduction of disciplinary referrals and suspensions). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nAttainment (reduced percentage of drop-outs, increased graduation rate). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nStudent performance in core academic subjects (English, mathematics, science, and social studies). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nIdentification of and support to \"at-risk\" students. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nHome Base Guidance program and home-school communications. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nStudent participation in extracurricular activities. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nStudent placement in Regents classes (beginning in 1989-90, as a goal shared by high schools and middle schools). \r\n\r\n\r\nAll Schools \r\nSchools are encouraged to set goals that extend beyond the areas listed above. As examples, the school improvement plan might include goals for: \r\nImproved school 	climate. \r\n( â€¢â€¢ 	Enhanced linkage with the community. Increased parent involvement. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nKU5644A 	4 \r\n() \r\n. (3) IMPLEMENTATION: Planning activities to accomplish goals. \r\nThe activities and strategies that are chosen to accomplish goals will differ from school to school. l~ developing their plans, schools are encouraged to consider: \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nChoosing an instrument, such as a surveyor questionnaire, to assess school climate. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nDesigning a staff development program to support improvement goals. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nDesigning interdisciplinary approaches to the delivery of instruction. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nDirecting resources such as time, budget and staff toward prioritygoals of the plan. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nDesigning an exercise through which a collective vision for renewal/restructuring of the school is developed. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nAt the elementary level, desig~ing strategies for implementing the stet Up to Learning program (grades K-3) as part of improvement goals in anguage arts and mathematics. \r\n\r\n\r\n(4) 	\r\nMONITORING/EVALUATION: Closely monitoring the plan and evaluating the extent to which its goals are reached. \r\n\r\n(5) 	\r\nACCOUNTABILITY: Accepting responsibility for presenting the plan and reporting the results to the school community. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe school. community includes school faculty and staff, parents, students, and community and business leaders. \r\nPLANNING FORMAT: \r\nForms for the completion of the school improvement plan (formerly called the school report) are available from the following persons: \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nElementary Schools: Line Supervisors (R. Elmer, S. Moore, A. Weintraub). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nMiddle Schools: Director of Middle Schools (J. Slattery). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nHigh Schools: Line Supervisors (M. Bell, D. Phillips). \r\n\r\n\r\nr~ \r\n1\\, \\ \r\n. ) \r\n1988-89 PLANNING CYCLE \r\nSince school-based planning teams were not formed until late in the fall, the 1988-89 planning cycle will differ from a typical planning cycle that is based on the school year. The minimum planning requirements for each school will be the development of a school improvement plan (formerly called the school report) that sets goals in the areas outlined in the previous section (Planning Requirements). School improvement plans should be completed and submitted to the Deputy Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction by the beginning of the second semester (January 30, 1989). \r\nBefore submitting plans to the Deputy Superintendent, the planning team should review ~heir plan to: \r\nâ€¢ 	Ensure that school goals are measurable, and to establish a data base against which progress toward goals can be measured. \r\nVerify that each school\'s goals address issues identified in the \r\nâ€¢ \r\nassessment process, as well as District requirements for planning. \r\n( \r\n, \r\nâ€¢ 	Ensure that they have consulted with the appropriate District departments and personnel wherever their goals relate to District programs, procedures or regulations. \r\nBefore plans are submitted to the Deputy Superintendent, each planning team should present its plan to the school faculty and staff. In accordance with the definition of accountability, each school planning team must also present its improvement plan to the school community. Presentation of plans should take place before spring recess (March 24th). . \r\nThe last phase of the planning cycle is evaluation, which cannot be completed until student performance information for 1988-89 is available to schools (usually in August). Once the school has evaluated its success in meeting the goals of its plan, the results should be summarized in a report that is forwarded to the Deputy Superintendent before it is presented to the community. The school\'s \"report card\" to the community should be presented no later than the time that the 1989-90 plan is presented. (It may be desirable to present both at the same time.) \r\nQuestions about the planning cycle can be directed to: \r\nL. Johnson; Deputy Superintendent for Curriculum and\r\nâ€¢ \r\nInstruction (ext. 2300). \r\nJ. Scully, Supervising Director of School Improvement\r\nâ€¢ \r\n(ext. 2307) \r\nf r~ \r\n\\ \' , \r\n, J \r\n1988-89 PLANNING PARAMETERS \r\nWAIVERS \r\nThe School District is governed and operated by a myriad of federal and state laws, regulations, Board policies, administrative regulations, contractual agreements, and other agreements. \r\nPlans to improve student performance developed and forwarded by schoolâ€¢based planning teams may refer to the need for an existing regulation, policy, or agreement to be waived. \r\nA process for responding to buildings\' requests for waivers will be developed by the end of the first semester and communicated to all teams. Waiver requests will be addressed by appropriate governing bodies. \r\nBUDGET \r\nIt is expected that the current school budget will be shared with all members of the planning team. The principal should also review with the team existing guidelines for managing the budget. \r\nA series of workshops regarding existing guidelines for managing the budget will be offered in spring 1989. \r\nBecause the development of the District\'s budget and the allocation of resources to schools continue to tre governed centrally, budget development and the criteria for resource distribution will not change significantly in the next school year (1989-90). \r\nIn the future, however, policies and procedures must change in order for the District to implement school-based budgeting. A task force will be formed to determine the changes that must occur, and to develop appropriate recommendations to achieve the objective of school-based budgeting. The work of this task force will be one component of the larger goal of decentralized decision-making (school-based management). It is generally agreed that this will be an evoluâ€¢tionary, multi-year task, with a target achievement range of three to five years. \r\nThe 1989-90 line item budget for each school will be similar to the line item budget that now exists. Currently, certain line items can be adjusted within existing allocated amounts. If building improvement plans call for reallocation of resources, this may be done consistent with existing budget management guidelines. Additional funds or resources from the local budget will not be allocated once the budget has been established for each school (spring 1989 Budget Process). Plans must be developed within the existing allocated budget and resources. \r\nKU5644A 7 \r\n(\') \r\nPERSONNEL/STAFFING \r\nThe District\'s hiring and transfer practices are currently guided by contractual agreements, administrative regulations, Board policies, state and federal regulations, legislation and other existing contracts or agreements. \r\n1) Transfers \r\nThe contractual agreement between the District and the Rochester Teachers Association contains the following statement with regard to school-based planning: \r\nSection 24 \r\n8 b. 	Vo 1unta ry trans fers effect i ve for the school year 1989-90 shall be contingent upon recommendation and approval of a mutually agreed upon building-based screeni ng committee. The makeup of thi s committee and its review procedures shall be agreed upon no later than January 1, 1989. Implementation of this provision is contingent upon successful development of a mutually acceptable school-based planning model. \r\nIn addition, transfer agreements regarding teachers affected by restrucâ€¢\r\n( \\ turing of secondary schools extends through July 1990. This agreement, unless \r\n~ 	amended by the District and the RTA, remains in effect and supercedes procedures that may be developed by a school-based planning team. \r\n2) Hiring \r\nIn several schools, teachers and other individuals have be~n involved in screening, interviewing and recommending staff to fill bona fide vacancies. During 1988-89, school-based planning teams may review current bL ~ding practices with respect to screening, interviewing and recommending candidates to fill teaching vacancies, and may revise or initiate new building procedures. Procedures for the selection of administrative and other staff are currently under review, and it is expected that guidelines will be developed and available for school teams by May 1, 1989. \r\n(/ \r\nTRAINING \r\nFull Planning Teams \r\nThe December 1988 and January 1989 orientation meetings will provide team members with information about the planning process, and about technical assistance available to assist them in developi~g, implementing and evaluating their improvement plans. Additional training will be provided in response to individual requests from school teams (i.e., training in specific areas such as decision-making, problem solving and group dynamics). Teams interested in additional training should contact the Office of Staff Development or School Improvement .. \r\nParents . \r\nAn orientation workshop specifically for parents is currently being planned by the Office of School Improvement, in conjunction with the Parent Negotiator and the Office of Parent and Community Involvement. The workshop is planned for \r\n\\ 	late January or February 1989. Additional workshops may be offered later this year, based on the interest expressed by parents who serve on school teams. Requests for parent workshops should be directed to the Parent Negotiator, Office of Parent and Community Involvement, or Office of School Improvement. \r\nStudents \r\nThe Office of School Improvement is planning an orientation in February 1989 for students elected to the high school planning teams. Questions or requests for additional training should be directed to the Office of School Improvement. \r\nFor assistance please contact: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nThomas Banister, Parent Negotiator (ext. 2307).\r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nSamuel McCree, Office of Parent and Community Involvement (ext. 2390). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nAnn Delehant, Office of Staff Development (ext. 2359). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nJoanne Scully, Office of School Improvement (ext. 2307). \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nJean Banister, Office of School Improvement (ext. 2536). \r\n\r\n\r\n\\ \r\nCOLLABORATION WITH THE NATIONAL CENTER ON EDUCATION AND THE ECONOMY \r\n\r\nA committee comprised of teachers, Â·parents, principals, central office administrators, and the senior associate of the National Center on Education and the Economy is currently designing a workshop on site-based management, with these goals: \r\n1. 	\r\nProvide an opportunity for participants to develop teamâ€¢building skills, including consensus building, decisionâ€¢making, role clarification, the art of negotiation, etc. \r\n\r\n2. 	\r\nProvide for the application of these skills, through a sequence of activities leading to the development of the framework for a school plan by the site-based team. \r\n\r\n3. 	\r\nProvide time for team members to meet as teams and in \"role.alike\" groups in which they will participate in discussions that will link them with colleagues in the District, as well as with consultants. \r\n\r\n\r\n( \r\n4. 	\r\nProvide key members of the central administration the opportunity to listen to the direction proposed by the teams, and to begin to map out a strategy by which their departments may provide support vital to the success of school initiatives. \r\n\r\n5. 	\r\nStructure an opportunity for the members of the Rochester City School District Board to participate in discussions as the teams move into development of school plans. The purpose of this activity is to assist Board Members in framing their thinking regarding Board policy which would support the direction taken by school teams. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the workshop will be offered several times during the remainder of the school year and summer 1989 to give all teams who wish to participate an opportunity to do so. All workshops that are scheduled will address the first three goals stated above. \r\nThe first scheduled workshop will also address goals four and five. As a result of this workshop, participating school teams will develop plans or proposals for the Board of Education\'s consideration in developing or changing policy that will govern school-based management in the future. \r\nQuestions or suggestions for these workshops should be directed to: \r\nSonia Hernandez, Senior Associate of the National Center on Education and the Economy (546-7620).Joanne Scully, Workshop Committee Chairperson, Office of School Improvement (ext. 2307). \r\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOL-BASED PLANNING TEAMS \r\n\r\nThere are numerous persons in our schools, at central office, and in the local community who can provide technical assistance to school-based planning teams, in areas such as group dynamics, group facilitation, assessment, data analysis, problem solving, planning and evaluation. The Office of School Improvement has prepared a document that lists some of the District departmentsand personnel who can either provide direct assistance to planning teams, or help them locate the resources they seek. School teams may call Joanne Scully (ext. 2307) for a copy of this document. \r\n( \\ \" \r\n\"\\ / \r\n\r\n'),(6462,7,2,48,0,'Toledo Federation of Teachers, Initials.

Qualifications are a \r\nminimum of five (5) years of outstanding teaching service, and five references (three from \r\nteachers who were currently teaching in the same building as the applicant and a \r\nrecommendation from the TFT building representative and building principal). After a \r\npreliminary paper screening, applicants are interviewed. The teachers selected have a variety \r\nof backgrounds, including special education, physical education, elementary, and secondary \r\neducation. The teaching performance of the prospective applicants is observed by former \r\nconsulting teachers. \r\n\r\nThe consulting teachers are limited to three years actual experience in the program after which \r\nthey return to their regular classroom assignment .. Each consulting teacher receives an \r\nadditional $5,165 in salary. Consulting teachers attend meetings of the Intern Board of Review \r\nwhich are held during the school year. \r\n\r\nThe consulting teachers submit periodic reports to the Intern Board of Review regarding the \r\nstatus of each of the interns with whom they are working. During the first year, the \r\nobservation and subsequent evaluations are done solely by the consulting teacher. The \r\nprincipal completes the Principal Summary form (see page 11 of the Toledo Plan Intern/\r\nIntervention/Evaluation) and forwards it to the consulting teacher who shares the \r\nevaluation with the intern. During the second year of probation, it is the principal\'s \r\nresponsibility to evaluate and make a recommendation regarding the status of the teacher. The \r\nsame evaluation procedures and standards are used. Four-year limited contracts are granted \r\nafter the second successful year. \r\n\r\nThe program is governed by the Intern Board of Review consisting of five union \r\nrepresentatives and four management. representatives. The Intern Board of Review accepts or \r\nrejects the evaluation recommendations of the consulting teachers, assigns consulting teachers, \r\ncontrols applicable inservice, manages the budget, and is responsible for all other aspects of \r\nthe program. Recommendations of the Intern Board of Review are sent to the superintendent \r\nwho, under Ohio law, recommends the termination or contract renewal to the Toledo Board of \r\nEducation. \r\n\r\nThe chairmanship of the Intern Board of Review is rotated annually between the president of \r\nthe Toledo Federation of Teachers and the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and \r\nInstruction. \r\n\r\nThe intern program can be terminated by either union or management at any time upon written \r\nnotice. June, 1998 marked the end of the seventeenth year of the program\'s existence. About \r\nten percent of all intern teachers fail to meet the performance standards of the program. \r\n\r\n\r\n'),(6940,16,2,40,0,'1998-09'),(6941,16,2,47,0,'CC'),(6942,16,2,46,0,'Professional Development'),(6943,16,2,42,0,'pdf'),(6944,16,2,51,0,'Document'),(6945,16,2,43,0,'3480012'),(6946,16,2,38,0,'Los Angeles, CA'),(6947,16,2,1,0,'-SPECIAL EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\n.......-.. \r\n\r\n\r\n.. ....... . \r\n\r\n\r\n,A Teacher Guide to Peer Review \r\n\r\n\r\n, This year, UILA members, will be discussing and debating a proposal, not yetfinalized. from the l!1\'LA Accountaqility \r\n, Committee to establish a peer assistance and peer review program. Unlike peer assistance, peer review -permitting \r\n\r\nteachers to evaluate ot~r teachers -is very controversial, as evidenced by the sharp debate at last year\'s National \r\n, Education Association, Representative Assembly. This special edition of A Second Opinion is a contribution to that \r\n\", discussIon. In case you didn \'/ see It, we are reprinting an article critical ofpeer review which appeared In a June issue \r\n\"ofUnited Teacher, as well as an opinion piece ofour own. \r\n\r\n, REPRlNT,\' United Teacher, June 19,1998 \r\n\r\nPeer Assistance -Yes! \r\n\r\n, \' \r\n\r\nPeer Review -No! \r\n\r\nAfter a discussIon period on \"professional accountability,\" \r\nUTLA members will be asked to vote on a peer \r\nreview program that would involve teachers in assisting \r\nand ultimately evaluating other teachers, possibly leading \r\nto their dismissaLAs UTLA activists, we wholeheartedly \r\nsupport the creation of a comprehensive peer assistance \r\n\r\n, (or coaching) program within LAUSD. However, we \r\nadamantly oppose peer review programs that could put \r\nteachers in the position of firing or recommending the \r\nfi,ring ofteachers. \r\n\r\nWhen we vote, we should only support a peer assistance \r\nprogram in which, without exception, all interactions \r\nbetween teacher andconsulting teacher are strictly \r\nconfidential and non-evaluative. \r\n\r\nNew teachers and many veteran teachers, as well, \r\nwould greatly benefit from an adequately funded and \r\nstaffed peer assistance program. Teaching is an isolating \r\nactivity. Student teaching and education theory courses do \r\nnot prepare teachers sufficiently for what they will experience \r\nin the classr90m, causing so many new teachers to \r\nleave the profession after a few years. \r\n\r\nWhile no panacea, some kind of \"on the job training\" , \r\ncomponent is needed which would eventually meet the\' \r\nfollowing goals: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ All first and second year teachers, as well as veteran \r\nteachers on a volunteer basis, would participate in the \r\nPeer Assistance program. \r\nâ€¢ Veteran teachers receiving poor evaluations from \r\nadministration would be especially encouraged to partici-pate \r\nin a peer assistance program. Perhaps the contract \r\nshould require that a teacher given an \"unsat\" or who is \r\n\"on notice\" be given an opportunity to receive peer assistance \r\nfor an extended period of time before any action is \r\n~enon hislher job status. \r\nâ€¢ Consultinglmentoring teachers would be full-time, \r\nout-of-classroom positions for no more than three consecutive \r\nyears and would be subject to a rigorous selection, \r\ntraining, and\'accountability process. \r\nâ€¢ Reasonable teacher/consulting teacher ratios should \r\nbe established to ,allow for substantive and timely interac, \r\ntion. \r\nUnlike peer assistance, which is supportive and nonthreatening, \r\npeer review programs are intimidating and \r\npotentially punitive. In most of these programs, poorly \r\nperforming teachers are singled out by administrators or \r\n\r\n\r\n(Owr) \r\n\r\nA Second Opinion Viewpoint \r\n\r\nWhy UTIA Members Should \r\nOppose Peer Review \r\n\r\nBy JOEL JORDAN, City of Angels HS, House of Reps \r\nE-mail: joeljordan@earthlink.net \' \r\n\r\nUTLA members should pay close attention\' ii\'the \r\ncontinuing debate over peer assistance and peer review, \r\nespecially as it relates to the issue of\"accountability.\" To \r\nbegin with, peer assistance and peer review are two .very \r\ndifferent things, even though they are often discussed in \r\nthe same breath. Peer assistance involves coaching or \r\nmentoring new, and in some cases veteran teachers, most \r\neffectively in complete confidentiality. Given the inadequacies \r\nof the District\'s current mentor teacher program, \r\nwe very much favor a well-funded peer assistance program \r\nwhich can, at the very least, offer assistance to all \r\nnew teachers. \r\n\r\nPeer review programs, on the other hand, put teachers \r\nin the position of evaluating other teachers, including \r\nrecommending that they be fired. A Second Opin\'ion \r\nstrongly recommends that UTLA members vote against \r\nany program that includes peer review. Putting teachers in \r\nthe position of firing other teachers compromises the \r\nproper role of our union, which is to defend, not punish, \r\nbargaining unit membe.rs. George Woods, chairperson of \r\nthe UTLA Accountability Committee that is writing the \r\npeer review proposal mentioned by Higuchi, admits as \r\nmuch in a receht United Teacher commentary. Referring \r\nto the urban I~als around the country that have adopted \r\npeer review programs, he points out that \" ... they have \r\n\r\n.

In fact, the \r\nparadigm makes perfect sense. From a \r\nunion point of view, the only justification \r\nfor workers being in the position \r\noffiring other workers is if they have \r\ncontrol over the craft or profession, \r\nincluding hiring. Do we? Of course \r\nnot. Teachers are under the domination \r\nof our employers -the education bureaucracy, \r\nthe school board, and the \r\nlegislature -with no control over training, \r\nhiring, pay, curriculum, class size, \r\nthe condition of our students, or anything \r\n.else. Under these conditions, why \r\nwould we\' want to take responsibility \r\nfor evaluating the performance of our \r\nÂ· colleagues?The whole thing is a set up \r\n.. to allow us to be our own executioners, \r\n\r\nputting a few teachers in the position \r\nof doing the work of administrators. \r\nWe all know what a joke the Stull \r\nevaluation is. Instead let\'s demand \r\nthat the District be \"accountable\" to \r\ndevelop a better evaluation program \r\nwhich gives teachers more feedback \r\nand guards against arbitraIy, vindictive \r\nprincipals. \r\n\r\nSo why do more and more teacher \r\nunion leaders propose peer review \r\nprograms? Leaving aside all rhetoric \r\nabout improving our profession, they \r\nare mainly concerned about combating \r\nattacks on public education by \r\nConservative forces that manipulate \r\nthe public\'s genuine concern over the \r\nstate of our schools. As George \r\nWoods hopes out loud, \"[peer review \r\nmay] be a small step in convincing \r\nthe critics of public education that we \r\nare serious about improving the instruction \r\nall our children receive.\" \r\nThe problem is that peer review will \r\ndo nothing to improve teacher performance. \r\nIn fact, it will actually detract \r\nfrom our ability to improve public \r\nschools by fostering the illusion that \r\n\r\nbad teachers are the main problem, \r\n\'thereby giving further ammunition to \r\nthe Right in its attacks on teachers \r\nand public education. Instead, UTLA \r\nshould focus on the key factors affecting \r\ninstruction, such as poor \r\nteacher training, high student/teacher \r\nratios, inadequate resources, noncompetitive \r\nteacher salaries, and student \r\npoverty. In the final analysis, the \r\nquality of teaching and learning will \r\nonly improve if these factors are ad~ \r\ndressed. And that can only be accomplished \r\nwith the persistent pressure \r\nof strong, progressive teacher unions \r\nand their allies. Anything, like peer \r\nreview, which weakens the solidarity \r\nof our union, should therefore be \r\nopposed. As for the honest critics of \r\npublic education, it is our responsibility \r\nas teachers to educate the public \r\nabout the conditions under which \r\nwe work and to ask them to join with \r\nus in changing them. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we should not accept \r\npeer review just because a few other \r\nurban locals around the country have\' \r\ndone so, most likely under similar \r\npublic pf.essure. Most urban locals do \':\'. \r\nnot have peer review.

Her 3rd and 4th graders were too \r\nrowdy to sit at tables, rather than desks. \r\nA hands-on science experiment turned \r\ninto \"two-by-fours swinging around the \r\nroom.\" By December, she was in tears, \r\nready to quit. \r\n\r\nBut with help from a consulting teacher \r\nassigned to her as part of an innovative \r\nprogram here, Ms. Bouknight has survived \r\nher first year of teaching at Heyl Elementary \r\nSchool. Her mentor provided \r\nencouragement, professional articles, and \r\nseasoned advice on everything from organizing \r\nreading groups to parent conferences \r\nto classroom management. \r\n\r\n\"I could talk to her about anything,\" the \r\nfirst-year teacher said recently. \"She was \r\nthere for me when I needed her.\" \r\n\r\nIn the end, Ms. Bouknight received a \r\ngood evaluation from her consulting \r\nteacher that will allow her to continue to \r\nteach-a decision once left solely to principals. \r\nSince the 1980s, teachers in a \r\nhandful of urban districts with peer-assistance \r\nand -review programs have borne \r\nthis responsibility, helping new teachers \r\nas well as veterans who are having problems. \r\nIn both cases, the consulting teachers \r\ncan recommend dismissal. \r\n\r\nIn the past year, the idea of peer review \r\nhas rocketed into the policy spotlight \r\namid a greater focus on accountability in \r\neducation. Bob Chase, the president of the \r\nNational Education Association, has embraced \r\nit as a way for teachers to take \r\ngreater responsibility for school qualitywhat \r\nhe calls the \"new unionism.\" Last \r\nsummer, delegates to the NEA\'S convention \r\nvoted to drop their opposition to the practice, \r\nwhich stands conventional unionism \r\non its head by giving teachers a role in \r\nevaluation. \r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Teachers \r\nhas long supported peer review, although \r\nrelatively few of its affiliates have negotiated \r\nsuch programs. \r\n\r\nLast month, a conference here sponsored \r\nby the Columbus Education Association-\r\nan NEA affiliate that has operated \r\na peer-review program for 12 years-drew \r\nmore than 500 teachers and union staff \r\nmembers from some 30 states. John \r\nGrossman, the president of the CEA, joked \r\nthat he organized \r\nthe meeting in selfdefense \r\nafter being\r\n\r\nRAISING \r\n\r\noverwhelmed with \r\nthe STAKES inquiries from interested \r\neducators. \r\nColumbus leaders \r\n\r\nAn Occasional Series \r\n\r\nwere joined by officials \r\nfrom three AFT affiliates-Toledo, \r\nOhio, which pioneered peer review in \r\n1981, Cincinnati, and Rochester, N.Y. \r\n\r\nThe state of Ohio has appropriated $4.8 \r\nmillion over the past two years for grants \r\nto districts interested in planning \r\nor implementing peer review. Union leaders \r\nin Columbus and Toledo are writing \r\nsample contract language that could be \r\nused in districts of various sizes. \r\n\r\n\'\'We\'ve come along fast within NEA,\" said \r\nMr. Grossman, who defied his state and \r\nnational organizations in launching the \r\nprogram in 1986. \"Once that embrace \r\nhappens, it\'s a bear hug.\" \r\n\r\nA Helping Hand \r\n\r\nWith the increased attention to peer review, \r\nhowever, has come confusion over its purpose. \r\nWhile the idea of teachers helping to dismiss \r\npeers who don\'t measure up has caught hold, \r\nthe programs actually devote much more time \r\nand resources to mentoring new teachers. \r\n\r\nPeer review is about \"helping people to \r\nsucceed,\" Mr. Chase said here in a speech \r\nat the conference. \r\n\r\n\"To characterize peer assistance and review \r\nas getting rid of bad teachers,\" he \r\ncautioned, \"is a gross misrepresentation of \r\nwhat it\'s all about.\" \r\n\r\nIndeed, the number of veteran teachers \r\nreferred to the programs for \"intervention\" \r\nis typically very small. \r\n\r\nYet experts say peer review offers one \r\nsolution to a problem that has long vexed \r\nschool administrators and education poli\r\n\r\n\r\ncymakers: how to identify and deal with \r\nteachers who aren\'t performing to the levels \r\ntheir students need or that higher \r\nstandards of teaching demand. \r\n\r\nIn Toledo, 52 experienced teachers out of \r\na pool of about 2,600 have been placed in \r\nintervention over 16 years. All but 10 \r\nhave left the classroom. About 10 percent \r\nof Toledo\'s intern teachers are rejected for \r\na second year of teaching. \r\n\r\nSince its inception 12 years ago, 178 \r\nteachers have entered the Columbus district\'s \r\nintervention program, out of a \r\nteaching force of 4,800. Of those, 43.8 percent \r\nleft the program in \"good standing.\" \r\nThe others resigned, retired, received disability \r\nretirements, or were terminated. \r\nThere is no limit on the length of time \r\nthat Columbus teachers can stay in intervention, \r\nas long as they are deemed to be \r\nmaking progress. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, 3,312 new teachers \r\nparticipated in Columbus\' intern program \r\nand 3,094 received satisfactory evaluations, \r\na success rate of 93 percent. The intern \r\nprogram is limited to one school year. \r\n\r\nNew teachers stay on the job far longer \r\nin Columbus than in typical urban districts \r\nthat lack such programs, where \r\nabout 50 percent of new hires leave after \r\nfive years. In Columbus, 80 percent of \r\nnew teachers remain on the job five years \r\nlater, Mr. Grossman said. \r\n\r\nA Broader View \r\n\r\nWhile it hasn\'t received much attention, \r\nthat aspect of peer review is likely to become \r\nincreasingly important as districts \r\naround the country confront increased demands \r\nfor new teachers to replace those \r\nretiring and to keep up with enrollment \r\ngrowth. The Columbus district expects to \r\nhire some 700 new teachers in the coming \r\nschool year. \r\n\r\nThe district works closely with Ohio \r\nState University, which provides training \r\nfor the consulting teachers and a series of \r\nsix free workshops for first-year teachers. \r\n\r\nProponents say peer-review programs \r\nalso provide a welcome career opportunity \r\n\r\nContinued on page 2 \r\n\r\n\r\nJune 3, 1998\' EDUCATION WEEK 2 \r\n\r\nfor the top-notch teach\r\n\r\n\r\ners who are chosen to RAISING \r\n\r\nserve as consulting \r\n\r\nlheSTAKES \r\n\r\nteachers. They receive a \r\n\r\nstipend in addition to \r\n\r\ntheir regular salaries. \r\n\r\nIn Columbus, such consultants work for \r\nthree years and then return to the classroom-\r\nbut with a much broader view of \r\ntheir district and of high-quality teaching \r\nthan they had before, participants say. \r\n\r\nLisa Hobson, who is finishing her first \r\nyear as a full-time consulting teacher \r\nhere, has a caseload of 22 educators. One \r\nis a veteran in intervention, while the others \r\nare new teachers, three of whom \r\ntaught elsewhere before landing jobs in \r\nColumbus. \r\n\r\n\"It\'s a very interesting job,\" said Ms. \r\nHobson, a 14-year veteran. \"I\'ve learned \r\nmore about teaching than at any time in \r\nmy career. It\'s given me a lot of time to \r\nthink about what causes a classroom to \r\nwork and not to work.\" \r\n\r\nNo \'Dipstick\' \r\n\r\nUnion leaders say peer-review programs \r\nare far superior to what Mr. Grossman \r\ncalls the \"dipstick\" evaluations conducted \r\nby harried principals. \r\n\r\nBecause they receive ex-\r\n\r\nof 50 hours observing \r\nteachers in the classroom. \r\n\r\nBut in Rochester, the local union representing \r\nadministrators filed a lawsuit, \r\nwhich was ultimately unsuccessful, arguing \r\nthat evaluation was the job of principals. \r\nSince then, administrators have accepted \r\nthe idea of peer review. \r\n\r\nOhio\'s laws for teachers are so stringent \r\nthat unions previously could-and didfind \r\nprocedural ways to overturn many \r\ndismissals initiated by administrators. \r\n\r\nTom Mooney, the president of the Cincinnati \r\nFederation of Teachers, says his \r\nunion fought \"costly, ugly arbitrations\" \r\nover teacher dismissals in part because \r\nthey appeared to be random and in part to \r\nshow the American Federation of Teachers \r\naffiliate\'s strength to ward off competition \r\nfrom the NEA. \r\n\r\nBut that approach ignored the fact that \r\nsome Cincinnati teachers had serious \r\n\r\nproblems, he said. Those teachers received \r\nno help from either the union or the district. \r\nIn addition, the eFT had railed against \r\nbureaucracy, but it needed to show it was \r\nserious about teacher quality in exchange. \r\n\r\n\"It\'s pretty tough to say that we ought to \r\nhave a predominant say in programs, curriculum, \r\nmethods, and books,\" Mr. \r\n\r\nIn Cincinnati, a principal with concerns \r\nabout a teacher\'s performance must refer \r\nthe teacher for intervention, rather than \r\n\"zap\" her with special evaluations, Mr. \r\nMooney said. The process offers teachers \r\nmore resources and protection, and it \r\nguarantees \"a serious investigation,\" he \r\nsaid. \r\n\r\n\r\nIntervention is in\r\n\r\n\r\nMooney said at the confer\r\n\r\n\r\ntended for teachers with\r\n\r\nence, \"and then say the re\r\n\r\n\r\ninstructional problems,\r\n\r\nview of professional practice \r\n\r\nnot those who are fre\r\n\r\n\r\nis somebody else\'s job.\" \r\n\r\nJohn quently late or absent or\r\n\r\nProponents of peer-review \r\n\r\nGrossman who exhibit substance\r\n\r\n\r\nprograms argue that they \r\n\r\nabuse problems, union\r\n\r\nsave money by reducing the \r\n\r\nleaders say.

Logan, a labor-relations \r\nconsultant for the Columbus Education \r\nAssociation. \r\n\r\n\r\nUnions still offer their members help if \r\nthey contest peer-review decisions. In \r\nstates with collective bargaining, unions \r\nhave a legal \"duty of fair representation\" \r\nthat some have interpreted to mean they \r\nmust fight all dismissals. \r\n\r\nIn fact, experts say, unions must simply \r\nshow that they use fair \r\n\r\nunion-district panels that \r\ngovern peer-review programs. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Toledo\'s program, \r\npeer review is not seen as a substitute for \r\nperiodic teacher evaluations by principals. \r\n\r\nThe Toledo Federation of Teachers earlier \r\nthis year fought a proposal by the district administration \r\nto institute regular evaluations \r\nof tenured teachers. Instead, principals can \r\nrefer teachers for a performance review and \r\nassistance ifthey feel it\'s necessary, subject \r\nto the approval of the board of review that \r\ngoverns the program. \r\n\r\nMore Protection \r\n\r\nProcedures for referring teachers for intervention \r\nvary. In Columbus, most of the \r\nteachers who undergo intervention asked \r\nfor the assistance themselves, often on \r\nthe heels of a poor evaluation from their \r\nprincipals. \r\n\r\ngrams and other means. \r\n\r\nCritical Attention \r\n\r\nAs interest in peer review spreads, skeptics \r\nare questioning whether all the \r\nhoopla is merited. They point out the relatively \r\nsmall number of teachers who are \r\n\"weeded out\" under peer review. \r\n\r\n\"There\'s some evidence to support Chase\'s \r\nclaims about his union\'s commitment to getting \r\npoor teachers out of the classroom-but \r\nnot a lot,\" concludes writer Robert Worth in \r\nan article in the May issue of The Washington \r\nMonthly. Mr. Worth argues that unions \r\nshould focus on reforming the state tenure \r\nlaws that make it \"extremely difficult to fire \r\nproblem teachers.\" \r\n\r\nObservers also are skeptical that peer \r\nreview will spread, despite the recent \r\npublicity. The programs require a high \r\nlevel of union-management trust and cooperation \r\nand could be difficult logistically \r\nfor small districts to manage, unless \r\nthey pool their resources. \r\n\r\nMyron Lieberman, a longtime union \r\ncritic, argues in a forthcoming book that \r\nit\'s difficult to evaluate peer-review programs, \r\nsince districts have varying criteria \r\nfor their success. \r\n\r\nAnd he complains that it is also hard to \r\ngauge the true costs of the programs, \r\nwhich include the salaries and stipends of \r\nthe consulting teachers, office expenses, \r\nand the like, as well as savings from reduced \r\nlitigation. \r\n\r\nBalancing those costs are the benefitsequally \r\nhard to measure-of ridding a district \r\nof ineffective teachers, and of helping \r\nyoung teachers like Ms. Bouknight remain \r\nin the profession. \r\n\r\n\"The culture of my school is that you \r\ndon\'t work with the other teachers,\" the \r\nfirst-year teacher said. But her mentor \r\n\"helped by building me up inside.\" \r\n\r\nReprinted from Education Week Magazine, June 3, 1998. \r\nReprinted by the Reprint Dept. 800-259-0470. \r\n\r\n\r\n'),(6293,18,2,49,0,'Education'),(6294,18,2,41,0,'Peer Assistance Review, An Award Winning Education Model'),(6295,18,2,39,0,'Columbus Education Association'),(6296,18,2,48,0,'Columbus Education Association, .

Education Today: What We Face \r\nAmerican public education is now experiencing \r\nthe kind of attention this nation has not given it \r\nsince the days of Sputnik in the late \'50s and the \r\nera of the Elementary and Secondary Education \r\nAct in the mid \'60s. It is a time of both tremendous \r\nopportunity and potential danger. During this \r\nhistoric period, there are two possible agendas for \r\neducation\'s consideration. One includes tuition tax \r\ncredits for private schools, to the certain detriment \r\nof the public school system. The other represents \r\nthe possibility of a great public education renewal \r\nand revival. The choices we make now may decide \r\nfor years to come whether or not public education, \r\nwill have the human resources, both to survive, and \r\nto provide for the nation at large. \r\nEducation must not experience the disasters we \r\nare now witnessing in other fields. Those wornÂ·out \r\nbridges we have been warned about in recent years \r\nare now falling down. Just as this nation has \r\nneglected its roads, bridges, railroads and basic inÂ· \r\ndustries like auto and steel, so too could it conÂ· \r\ntinue to passively watch the erosion of its human \r\nresources. Education\'s traditional pools of talent \r\nare now drying up. The older professionals who \r\nemerged from the Depression years are retiring. \r\nThe, talented women and minorities to whom \r\nteaching was one of the few available careers now \r\ngo elsewhere. \r\n. Repairing our national infrastructure will take \r\nyears of commitment and substantial resources. \r\nInsuring quality education will also demand time \r\nand money. Neither are passing fads. Without \r\nserious attention both sets of problems will only \r\nbecome worse. \r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Teachers was \r\namong the first to argue that developing human \r\ncapital takes intelligent investment. Before us now, \r\nin response to this argument, are a series of critical \r\nbut constructive reports, analyzing public educaÂ· \r\ntion\'s contemporary problems and offering many \r\nworthy, and some debatable, solutions. The most \r\nimportant of these are well known by now: \"A NaÂ· \r\ntion at Risk: The Imperative for Educational \r\nReform,\" the report of the National Commission on \r\nExcellence in Education; \"Action for Excellence,\" \r\nproduced by the Education Commission of the \r\nStates\' Task Force on Economic Growth; and the \r\n\"Report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force \r\non Federal/Elementary and Secondary Education \r\nPolicy.\" From these can arise both discussion and \r\naction on sound education reform. i \r\n\r\nWe believe that these reports can become a \r\nserious part of our national agenda only if those \r\nwho act on them at every level recognize that \r\nchange and improvement I cost money. Neither \r\nRORald Reagan nor any local school board should \r\nthink we will be fooled into believing that changes \r\ncan be made without added resources. \r\n\r\nWe have also argued strenuously that tuition tax \r\ncredits, whether they be instituted federally, at the \r\nstate level or locally, offer a recipe for dismantling \r\npublic education. It is impossible to underestimate \r\nthe ammunition the recent Supreme Court decision \r\nupholding Minnesota\'s tuition tax deduction plan \r\ngives to the advocates of tuition tax credits . \r\nBolstered with renewed energy, the push for tuition \r\ntax credits \'can divert our attention away from conÂ· \r\nstructive reform. Besides being dangerous, it can \r\nsap our energy and make us defensive. The time is \r\nupon us when virtually every policy move we make \r\nin education should be measured in terms of its \r\n\r\n64 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotential impact in the war over tuitio~ tax credits. \r\nIn these circumstances, the Amencan Federa\r\n\r\n\r\n\" \r\n\r\ntion of Teachers will make a clear choice. There is \r\nmuch in the new reports and the moves for reform \r\nthat we laud and commend. We will choose constructive \r\nengagement with all who support the \r\npublic education system, critical though they may \r\nbe of teachers, over any isolated, rigid position that \r\ncould have the effect of courting tuition tax credits. \r\nBesides, we think the public schools need changing \r\nanyway. The time to act is now if we are to have \r\nthe necessary talent to run the schools of tomorrow. \r\nOur agenda will be to: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ upgrade the public education program, and in \r\nso doing enlist broad public support for the \r\nschools; \r\nâ€¢ find ways to recruit and keep a quality teaching \r\nforce; \r\nâ€¢ prevent the enactment of tuition tax credit \r\nplans at all levels-federal, state and local. \r\n11_ Quality Education and Quality Teaching-A \r\nNew Agenda \r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Teachers welcomes \r\nthe discussion now under way among leading \r\nfigures in education, business, labor and government \r\nover the need to tighten standards of excellence \r\nin the public schools. We repeat here, as \r\nwe have said elsewhere, our stance in favor qf: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ stricter high school graduation requirements in \r\nacademic subjects including math, science, \r\nEnglish, history, and foreign languages, though not \r\nat the expense of other essentials like music, art, \r\nand vocational education; \r\nâ€¢ the use of fair and objective student testing to \r\ninsure a continuing relationship between school \r\nand grade completion and educational content; \r\nâ€¢ increased homework assignments; \r\nâ€¢ tougher requirements for student discipline; \r\nâ€¢ transfer of students who repeatedly prevent \r\nothers from learning to alternative settings until \r\nsuch time as they are able to return to a regular \r\nclassroom setting; \r\nâ€¢ curriculum review and renewal to insure use of \r\nthe best materials and updated information, \r\nespecially in areas like science, math, and computer \r\neducation. \r\nSince our special responsibility is to insure the \r\nfuture of quality teaching, we are particularly concerned \r\nthat today\'s education reform movement \r\nnot come up with faulty solutions and misguided \r\nemphasis. We are firm in our view that only competent\r\nÂ· teachers should be in the classrooms of this \r\nnation\'s schools. We believe that excellence \r\nshould be rewarded. We are distressed that the \r\nteaching profession is proving to be less and less \r\nattractive to high quality potential recruits and that \r\nit is losing some of its best and brightest to m~re \r\nlucrative private sector jobs. We also recognl~e \r\nthat whatever solutions are offered to address thiS \r\nproblem could significantly transform our schools. \r\nThis is not a simple problem that can be patched \r\nover with superficial answers. \r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Teachers welcomes \r\nthe opportunity to discuss this problem openly. \r\n\r\nWhile we have no final judgments, we have views \r\nand concerns. We believe that some options \r\nshould take priority over others. Incentive payor \r\ndiscretionary merit pay is not the first and best way \r\nto insure teacher quality. Unfortunately, the public \r\nand the media are giving it more attention than it \r\ndeserves. In fact, it is our fear that a preoccupation \r\nwith this Single idea will divert attention away from \r\na set of proposals much more likely to solve the \r\nproblem. In our view a real solution would include: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ An insistence on beginning teacher tests \r\nwhich will set a high standard for entry level \r\nteacher recruits. Minimum competency is not \r\nenough. All beginning teachers should be tested \r\nand required to meet a standard which represents \r\nat least the average of all college graduates. \r\nâ€¢ Higher teacher certification requirements that \r\nspecifically include gre~ter emphalilis on subject \r\nmatter competence ancl\'less emphasis on methods \r\ncourses. \r\nâ€¢ Radical increases in beginning teacher pay. \r\nUnless teachers can start teaching with salaries \r\nequivalent to those of other college graduates, we \r\nwill stand no chance of attracting good candidates. \r\nThis will mean entry salaries at least $6,000 to \' \r\n$8,000 higher than the current ones. \r\nâ€¢ Salary amounts and patterns that encourage \r\ngood teachers to stay in the profession. Salary \r\nschedules of 10 to 12 very small steps, spread out \r\nover a decade or more in years, can hardly serve \r\nthis purpose. Keeping good teachers is more likely \r\nwith adequate salary schedules of 3 to 5 years at \r\nmost. \r\nâ€¢ The need to maintain teacher excitement and \r\nintellectual stimulation. Teachers want to teach \r\ncourses that are challenging to students who are \r\ninterested. At least part of the attention given to \r\ncurriculum should also focus on how all teachers \r\ncan have schedules, courses, retraining and \r\nenrichment opportunities that act as incentives for \r\nthem to continue in the profession. \r\nâ€¢ Assurance that whatever measures schools \r\ntake to improve discipline and minimize disruption-\r\nnot turn teachers into policemen. Discipline \r\ncodes and school organfzation patterns should not \r\nburden teachers with responsibilities that sap their \r\nenergies and divert their attention away from their \r\nproper teaching role. \r\nâ€¢ Expanded opportunities for teacherS to help \r\nnew teachers, to implement staff development \r\nplans and to create patterns of collegial.ity t~at insure \r\nongoing professional renewal. ThiS Will undoubtedly \r\ncause major revision of the current \r\nauthority structure in schools and considerably \r\nalter the traditional role of the principal. We favor \r\nchange that would further separate administrative \r\nfunctions from educational leadership. \r\nâ€¢ Implementation of fair and practical methods \r\nfor removing incompetent teachers from the profession. \r\nThese must involve due process and be \r\nbased on evaluation criteria which teachers regard \r\nas objective and reasonable. \r\nIII. New Compensation Proposals \r\n. \r\nWhile we put our faith in reform measures like \r\n65 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.~ those cited above, we cannot ignore the current IV. The Unfinished Agenda \r\n\r\nmisguided preoccupation with the idea that incentive \r\npayor discretionary merit pay is the most important \r\ncure for what ails the ta\'aching profession. \r\nWe do not accept this view. There is little evidence \r\nto support it. We recognize that the public wants a \r\nresponse on this issue, and so we will offer one. \r\nBut, we hope thinking about it will not turn \r\nbusiness, pOlicy-makers and educators away from \r\nmore fundamental and sound solutions. \r\n\r\nTraditionally such pay plans have been plagued \r\nwith serious flaws. The history of such efforts is \r\nriddled with failure owing to their inherent subjectivity, \r\nstaff morale problems and the cumbersome \r\nnature of their administration. Few such plans \r\nreward more than a few teachers. Most keep the \r\nvast majority of teacher salaries low. All of this has \r\nbeen well documented. \' \r\n\r\nBut this said, we do think that some of the more \r\nrecent proposals allowing the advancement of \r\nlarge numbers of teachers to \"master teacher\" \r\ntype career roles involving extra pay warrant consideration. \r\nTherefore, while merit pay is not AFT \r\npolicy, under certain circumstances state federations \r\nand locals may feel the need to negotiate \r\nsuch plans. In such circumstances they should \r\nmeet the following criteria: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Any new compensation plan should have as a \r\nfundamental a higher base pay for all teachers. \r\nâ€¢ Evaluation cannot be left solely to principals \r\nand supervisors who have traditionally made subjective \r\njudgments about te,acher competence \r\nbased more on favoritism and patronage than \r\nmerit. New evaluation patterns should be \r\nnegotiated and must offer protections against subjectivity \r\nand local school politics. \r\nâ€¢ Those who do not receive extra pay should suffer \r\nno loss of tenure, job security or status. \r\nâ€¢ Decisions to grant additional pay must be subject \r\nto appeal and review procedures that are fair \r\nand objective. \r\nâ€¢ Any financial rewards offered must be part of a \r\nplan committed to improving the conditions and \r\npay of teachers who function in classrooms, and \r\nnot simply result in adding new layers of administration. \r\nâ€¢ The possibility of applying for and receiving additional \r\npay above a basic salary should be open to \r\nall applicants voluntarily. It should also be actually \r\nawarded to substantial proportions of the teaching \r\nforce. \r\nâ€¢ Once additional compensation is made it \r\nshould not be subject to diminution. \r\nâ€¢ Evaluation criteria should reflect the complexity \r\nof all the factors contributing to teacher and student \r\nsuccess. Any simplistic efforts to measure \r\nteacher success using student achievement \r\nscores should be opposed. \r\nâ€¢ Even if the above criteria are met, conditions \r\nvary locally and in different states. Therefore, such \r\nplans should not be imposed on teachers and \r\nshould not be adopted unless they are acceptable \r\nto teachers through collective bargaining or other \r\nappropriate actions. \r\nWe caution all educators and policy-makers that \r\nin the drive to raise standards, insist on excellence, \r\nand crack down on laxness and discipline, we not \r\nneglect those difficult children who are prone to \r\nfailure. For almost twenty years, our public schools \r\nhave concerned themselves with reaching the \r\nunderserved and the disadvantaged. Any new emphasis \r\non quality must continue with this goal. If \r\nraising standards creates problems for some, then \r\nthey must get speCial help. No new-found concentration \r\non stringency and performance should \r\ncause an increase in dropping out, a decline in high \r\nschool graduation or the creation of schools that \r\ndo not deliver for every child. Part of the adjustment \r\nwe may have to make must include the \r\nstrengthening of special programs for children with \r\nspeCial needs. . .\' \r\n\r\nThis kind of concern was behind nearly two \r\ndecades of growth in federal education dollars for \r\nthe poor, the handicapped and the non-English \r\nspeaking. Those dollars, and the dollars added to \r\nthem at the state and local levels, have produced \r\nprofoundly successful results. Research has \r\ndocumented these results over and over again. No \r\nargument for quality and excellence can ignore this \r\nexperience. Nor should any new emphasis replace \r\na continuing effort to serve these groups. \r\n\r\nThere can be no conflict between the goals of \r\nequal educational opportunity and educational excellence. \r\nAchieving both will cost money. We accept \r\nno cheap denials of the fact that in education \r\ndollars and standards must go hand in hand, \r\nwhether for the tested programs we know will work, \r\nor for the new ones we are about to try. \r\n\r\nV. An Action Plan \r\nOur dialogue has already begun on these matÂ· \r\nters with the education, media, government and \r\nbusiness worlds. In order to continue it at an even \r\nhigher level and in even greater intensity we plan to \r\ninitiate a series of internal discussions among our \r\nown leaders and members on the future details of \r\nour ,further response. We also intend to formalize \r\nour consultations with leaders in the broader socieÂ· \r\nty who are concerned with these issues. To begin \r\nits program the American Federation of Teachers \r\nannounces its intention to: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Invite a number of notable leaders from all \r\nwalks of me to serve on a special AFT Advisory \r\nCommission on Educational Quality. This group \r\nwill be asked to consult with us regularly on the \r\nbest ways of implementing education reform. \r\nâ€¢ Initiate a series of regional conferences beginning \r\nthis fall to discuss reform issues and to \r\nrecommend methods for carrying out change. \r\nâ€¢ Continue our efforts to defeat tuition tax \r\ncredits by discussing their implications for public \r\neducation and by opposing the election of any \r\npublic official who supports them. \r\nThese steps represent only a beginning. We intend \r\nto approach the opportunity before us as one \r\nthat will require enduring creativity and fortitude. \r\nWe also believe that without this kind of effort the \r\n\r\n66 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic schools that. made this country great face \r\npossible demise. It is with this in mind that we \r\nchoose to rethink our ways of defending them, and \r\nthrough that process, hope to make them better. \r\n(1983) \r\n\r\n\r\n'),(6271,19,2,50,0,'AFT Convention Report 1983'),(6251,20,2,49,0,'Education'),(6252,20,2,41,0,'Shared Decision Making'),(6253,20,2,39,0,'Dade Federation of Teachers'),(6254,20,2,48,0,'Dade Federation of Teachers, .

From this design team, a \"core\" team is developed, comprised of \r\nabout ten to fifteen people, the majority of whom are teachers. There are no hard and fast \r\noperational rules, other than the the design teams try to involve people on staff who are \r\nviewed as leaders in order to create a balanced core team. The design teams are open to \r\nanyone who is interested: likewise, any member of the staff can propose that a new design \r\nteam be formed around any issues of concern. \r\n\r\nThis group undertakes an extensive training program in communications and group \r\ndynamics. Participa~ts are taught to continually rethink their positions with a view toward \r\nconsensus. \r\n\r\nThe core team spends a considerable amount of time developing a \"vision of excellence\" for \r\ntheir school: How can the school be run as best as possible, both in the long and the short \r\nrun?

It? \r\n\r\nThe central idea is building-level \r\nautonany. Among areas usually included \r\nLii\'ider tne purview of school-based \r\nmanagement (SaM) are: \r\n\r\n1. \r\neducational outccmes \r\n2. \r\ncurriculum and instructional \r\ndecisions \r\n3. \r\nschool-based budgeting \r\n4. \r\nparental, caM\\unity and student \r\ninvolvement \r\n5. \r\npersoonel decisions \r\n6. \r\nmaintenance \r\n7. \r\n. non-instructional topics \r\n(discipline, safety, \r\nlunchroom, camlunity relations, \r\netc.) â€¢ \r\nThe rationale for SSM is that schools, \r\ncommunities, parents and students have \r\ndifferent needs, and tnat these needs \r\ncan best be aCCQfllociated at tne \r\nbuilding, not the district, level. \r\nThis still leaves great leeway, \r\nhowever, for decision-making at the \r\ndistrict level. Thus, according to \r\nLindelow , \"The SChOOL board makes \r\ngeneral system-wide policies, including \r\na::xnmi.tment to program, budgeting and \r\noperating autonomy of scnools, and does \r\nnot usurp or intrude upon \r\nadministrative implementation\" \r\n\r\n(Lindelow, 1981). \r\n\r\nMotives, however, often differ. SaM \r\nhas been invoked as tne hopeful answer \r\n\r\nto everything from achieving \r\ndesegregation eo enhancing teaching as \r\n! profession. sane see it polltically \r\n\r\nas tne extension of choice eo those \r\n\r\n(parents and carmunity) who have beal \r\nleft out of local decision-maKing. \r\nOthers view it as effective business \r\npractice, consistent with tne findings \r\nof how excellent companies are managed, \r\nwhile yet others emphasize potential \r\ngains in student achievement. \r\n\r\nAt times, these motives congeal and SaM \r\nis suggested as a remedy for a host of \r\n\r\nills. EmoarKing on a site-based \r\n\r\nmanagement course, one exuberant \r\n\r\nLouisiana school district expressed it \r\n\r\nthis way: \r\n\r\n-The site-based management effort will. \r\nmake a difference for our students. \r\nThe effort will get East Baton Rouge \r\nParish schools in canpliance with the \r\nDesegregation Court Order, pupil and \r\nteacher absenteeism will go down, test \r\nscoreswill go up, varxialism will go \r\ndown, ccmnuniq support will go up, \r\ndropouts, suspensions and expulsions \r\nwill go down, D:>rale of teachers will \r\ngo up and overall accountability will \r\nbe improved.Â· (At The Crossroads, East \r\nBaton Rouge pariSh ScnoOl Redesign \r\nPian, Into The Next Century, March 11, \r\n1988. ) \r\n\r\nDoes school-based managEment require \r\nShared decision-making (~? . \r\n\r\nOf particular l~terest to teaChers and \r\n\r\nlocal unions is the extent to which S8M \r\nentails some nocion of shared decisionmaKing. \r\nSSM Â£OCdels exist which do not \r\n\r\ninvolve teacners in meaningful \r\ndecision-making. 20r example, the East \r\nBaton Rouge Parish plan cited acove, \r\n\r\nwnile advocating that principals v-ork \r\ncollacorativelj with \"SChool advisory \r\ncouncils,\" is nonetheless clear about \r\n\r\nhow \r\ndecisions will be made: \"The \r\n\r\nprincipal remains the site-based leader \r\n\r\nand \r\nis ultimately accountable for \r\n\r\ndecisions and building performance. A \r\n\r\ncri tical factor in the harrronious \r\n\r\ninteractions of the prinCipal and the \r\n\r\nschool advisory council is trust.\" \r\n\r\n(East parish plan, page 4.) This \r\ncontrasts sharply with other \r\nschool-based management approaches that \r\ndo include shared decision-making. In \r\nHammond, Indiana, for example, where a \r\nschool improvement process (SIP) has \r\nbeen fostered in a number of schools, \r\nspecial attention has been given to \r\navoiding the traditional top-down \r\nhierarchy of decision-making.\"Although \r\n\r\n\r\nHammond school representatives have \r\nmade ita point not to set any ngid \r\nrules concerning SIP canrni.t tee \r\nmembership or meeting times and \r\nprocedures, there is one rule to which \r\nall teams are expected to adhere: a \r\nprincipal should never chair the sip \r\ncommittee, because this would merely \r\nperpetuate the traditiona1 top-down \r\napproach to school managenent.\" \r\n(Casner-Lotto, 1988) Similarly in Dade \r\n\r\nCounty puolic Schools in Miami, an \r\n\r\ninoovative pilot program is being \r\n\r\ninstituted\'which makes the connection \r\n\r\nbetween SaM and SOM explicit: IIThere \r\n\r\nis a close correlation between \r\nschool-based management/budgeting ana \r\n\r\nthe shared decision-making process. \r\nThey go hand in hand.\" (School eased \r\nManagement/Shared Decision-Making, A \r\nHistorical perspective, p. 73, Dade \r\nCounty Puolic Schools, Miami, Florida, \r\nOctober 1987) \r\n\r\nIndeed there is some evidence to \r\n\r\nindicate that districts which fail to \r\n\r\nlink the two are less likely to \r\nsucceed. One such case is \r\nAlbuquerque. The attempt to mandate \r\nschool-based budgeting in Albuquerque \r\n\r\nfailed recently for reasons the \r\nAlbuquerque Teachers Federation \r\nexpressed as follows: \r\n\r\n\"The school-based bOOgeting process as \r\nit now operates in the Albuquerque \r\nschool district appears to be a \r\ndElll1i\'Xra tic process with opportunities \r\nfor participation by a wide range of \r\neducational coostituencies. In \r\npractice, hcJ.1ever, it has resulted in \r\ndivisiveness, elimination of positions \r\nsuch as librarians and nurses, same \r\nprograms atrophy as inadequate sctxx>l \r\nbudgets are cut in order to fund \r\nspecial needs in any given school. \r\nFinal budget authority continues to \r\nrest with principals who often wield \r\nun:iue control aver the school-based \r\nbudget ccmnit tees. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ The booget \r\nocmnittees at each school stkxlld have \r\nthe final say on the budget, not the \r\nprincipal.â€¢ (AN Po6ition Paper: \r\nSchool-Based Budgeting) \r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that a \r\nresearch debate lays at the root of the \r\ncontroversy over linKing SSM wi th SOM. \r\nMuch of the impetus for SSM stems fran \r\nthe \"effective sChoolsll researcn. This \r\n\r\ndiverse, and sometimes conflicting, \r\n\r\nbody of research identified five \r\ngeneral characteristics associated with \r\neffective SChools: \" â€¢â€¢â€¢strong \r\n\r\nprincipal leadership, academic focus, \r\n\r\nhigh e~ectations, healthy and orderly \r\n\r\nenvironment, frequent monitoring of \r\nstudent achieve:rent.\" (Miller and \r\n\r\nLieberman, 1988) In their now classic \r\n\r\nreview of the effective schools \r\n\r\nliterature, Purkey and Smith (1983) \r\ndrew attention to school-site \r\nmanagement as one of the \"rrost \r\n\r\nimportant organizational-structura1 \r\n\r\nvariables\" connected witn effective \r\nschools. \r\n\r\nAt issue in some of the research, \r\nhowever, is the place of \"shared \r\ngovernance.\" On the one hand, much of \r\n\r\nthe effective schools literature \r\nattrioutes success to strong \r\ninstructional ~aadership by the \r\nprincipal. Yet, in the words of one \r\ncritic, IIcontra.ry to the traditional \r\nformula, the instructional leadership \r\nat most of the effective schools did \r\nnot depend solely on the principal.\" \r\n\r\n(Steadman, 1987. See also Zirkel and \r\nGreenwood, 1987) Others have gone even \r\nfurther in asserting that the research \r\n\r\ntakes the most CaMlOn form of school \r\norganization--the hierarchical type--as \r\ngiven. \"AS a result, ESR (effective \r\nschools research) and the school \r\neffectiveness crovement that springs \r\n\r\nfran it are primarily concerned with \r\nimproving scnools by making small \r\nadJustments rather than fundacrental \r\nchanges. This means that the \r\nassumptions on which traditional \r\n\r\nschooling is based remain unexamined \r\nand unchallenged.\" (Lauder and Khan, \r\n\r\n1988) \r\n\r\nThe approach taken by teachers in \r\n\r\nHamrrond, Dade and Albuquerque is \r\n\r\nconsistent with an approach to \r\n\r\nrestructuring education which seeks \r\n\r\nboth greater decentralization of \r\n\r\n2 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecision-making and at the same time \r\n\r\nalternatives to msting decision\r\n\r\n\r\nmalting structures. That is, the \r\n\r\nrealization of goals, such as the \r\n\r\nprofessionalization of teachers as well \r\n\r\nas the empowering of other \r\n\r\nconstituencies (parents, \r\n\r\nparaprofessionals, students) \'ioOuld seen \r\n\r\nto require the coupling of school-based \r\nmanagement with meaningful \r\nshared-decision malcing. AS The \r\nCarnegie Task Force on Teaching AS a \r\nProfession, A Nation prepa.;-ed, noted: \r\n\"No organi.za\'tion can function well \r\nwithout strong and effective leadership \r\nand schools are 00 exception. But the \r\nsingle model for leadership found in \r\nrost schools is better suited to \r\nbusiness or government then to the \r\nfunction of education.\" (Carnegie, p. \r\n61, 19S6) \r\n\r\nThe restructuring projects underway \r\nhave gone beyond the effective schools \r\nroovernent, then, in tw:> ways: first, by \r\nseeking to create structures not \r\nordinarily found in traditional \r\nscnools, and second, by examining sane \r\nof the assumptions on which traditional \r\nschooling is based. \r\n\r\nDoes School-Based Management Prcm:>te \r\nLearning? \r\n\r\nPromoting efficiency and enhancing \r\nautonomy for teachers are worthwhile \r\ngoals, but if at the same ~there is \r\nno impact on student learning, while \r\ncertain battles might be won, the war \r\nwill be lost. \r\n\r\nHow are we to judge whether or not \r\nSaM/SOO makes a difference? I t would, \r\nseem first necessary to clarify what is \r\nmeant by \"student learning.\" There is \r\na certain body of evidence (again from \r\nthe effective schools literature) which \r\ntakes as given the results of \r\nno~referenced standardized \r\nacnievement tests. The argument is \r\nthat those schools which practice \r\nSBM!SDM are toose whose stu:1ents excel \r\nat standardized tests. \"Student \r\nlearning\" then, becanes identified with \r\ntest performance. \r\n\r\n\'l\\<.O concerns nave surfaced wi th this \r\nline of re~ing. First, it is oot \r\nclear that the reporting of test scores \r\nhas been totally accurate, and second, \r\nthere is some apprehension that, even \r\nif accurate, damage can be inflicted on \r\nthe curriculum (and teaching) by \r\nnarrowing it to fit the kinds of basic \r\nsKills measured by existing tests \r\n(Steadman, 1987). In short, tnere is \r\nroUJiting concern with the Kinds of \r\nmeasures or indicators traditionally \r\nemployed to assess student learning. \r\nRestructuring schools will involve \r\nreexamining the instruments employed in \r\nassessment and evaluation. \r\n\r\nAnother sort of issue is raised by the \r\nquestion, It Do restructured schcx>ls \r\ndistract from student learning?\" That \r\nis, even if we could agree upon \r\nmeasures to assess performance, \r\nmeasures rore acceptable as accurate \r\nrepresentations of student learning \r\nthan standardized tests, there remains \r\nthe question of whether or oot \"the \r\nShifting of management responsibilities \r\nto the school level is in sane way a \r\ndistraction from the central processes \r\nof schooling, namely, learning and \r\nteachingâ€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢\" (Caldwell, 1988) Sane \r\nrecent commentators have warned against \r\nwholesale adoption of SBM/SDM \r\nstructures which model those envisioned \r\nin reports such as the 1986 Carnegie \r\nReport, A Nation Prepared. t<oehlerand \r\nFenstermacher (1988), for example, \r\nwonder whether calls for the \r\nprofessionalization of teaching which \r\nshift the focus of decision-maicing to \r\nvarious levels of the teaching force, \r\nare compatible with higher quality \r\nstudent learning. \r\n\r\nOf course there is 00 definitive answer \r\nto this issue and for the very simple \r\nreason that our experience with \r\nrestructuring schools is still in its \r\ninfancy. The case study cited by \r\nKoehler and Fenstermacher, for example, \r\nis very limited in scope, covering only \r\none K-6 elementary school, Desert View, \r\nwhose restructuring decisions seem to \r\nlack clear consensus on what \r\n\r\n3 \r\n\r\n\r\nconstitutes student learning, as well \r\nas questions regarding the \r\nappropriateness of the chosen \r\nimplementation strategies. \r\n\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it is tmperative to \r\nrealize tnat whatever SBM/SDM models \r\nare designed, the quality of student \r\nlearning will be affected. E\'ollowing \r\none path might lead, as it did in the \r\ncase of Desert View Elementary, to \r\nteachers spencling rore time on \r\ncollective decision-making and other \r\nmeetings than on instL\'uction, or to \r\nincreased educational problems for \r\nchildren, but things don\'t have to end \r\nup this way. It is instructive to \r\ncontrast, for example, successful \r\nrestructuring efforts, as in Germany\'s \r\nKoln-Holweide school (American \r\nEducator, spring 1988) when the \r\nmeasures urxiertaken stem fran the \r\nshared desire to create a school \r\ncatmunity. In Desert VieM, st1.Xients \r\nwere pulled out of class for special \r\nhelp; they roved classroom to \r\nclassroom, from teacher specialist to \r\nteacher specialist; and tnere was \r\nlittle apparent coherence in the \r\nfunctioning of teacher teams. tn \r\nKoln-Holweide, on the other hand, teams \r\nof teachers worK together employing \r\nmultiple instructional strategies (such \r\nas cooperative learning) allowing for \r\nstudents to remain in class for special \r\nhelp; teachers are. cooperatively \r\nresponsiole for rore than one academic \r\nspecialty; and students experience a \r\nsatisfying coherence in lessons, \r\ndiscipline, and classroom \r\ncommunication. Restructuring schools \r\nin Koln-Holweide means, among other \r\nthings, tnat, in the words of its head \r\nteacher, Anna Ratzki, \" â€¢â€¢â€¢ teachers are \r\nresponsible not merely for teaching \r\ntheir subjects but for the total \r\naducation of their students, for making \r\nsure that their st1.Xients succeed, \r\npersonally and academically.\" \r\n\r\n(American Eaucator ,Spring 1988) \r\nSSM/SDM is rore likely to succe~ when \r\nit springs fran concern for student \r\nsuccess than when it is tangential to \r\nit. \r\n\r\n~thereproblans ~!district \r\nmoves simUltaneously to centralize and \r\n\r\ndecentralize? \r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, SSM is perfectly \r\n\r\ncons~stent (and empirically coincident) \r\nwith a school ooard setting system-wide \r\n\r\ngoals.. However, conflict can still \r\n\r\narise. I t often does so when the \r\nquestion, \"Who controls the \r\ncurriculum?\" is raised. The rove to \r\ncentralize control over curriculum, a \r\nrove, for example, key to Thatcher\'s \r\n\r\nReform Plan in Britain, is also causing \r\nconflict here. In philadelphia, \r\n\r\nteachers have been advocating greater \r\ndecision-making authority at precisely \r\n\r\nthe same time the district had been \r\nattempting to impose a standardized \r\ncurriculum. (Education Week, March 23, \r\n\r\n1988) Similarly at the state level, a~ \r\na time when local districts such as \r\nHamoond are involved in pranoting \r\nshared decision-making, the state of \r\n\r\nIndiana is imposing a state-wide \r\ntesting program that\'s certain to \r\naffect the degree and extent of local \r\ninitiative. \r\n\r\n~general so Lutions seem possible. \r\nEitner, as in Philadelphia, some move \r\n\r\ntoward a less rigid, more flexible \r\napproach to curriculum, a compromise, \r\ncan be l?roposed or else (as in narrm:md \r\naoo Dade) waivers to existing \r\n\r\nregulations can be sought. \r\n\r\nWhat kinds of resources are necessary \r\nto effect SBH/saf? \r\n\r\n\r\nAs in all cnange, time and money are \r\ncritical resources. Dade, for example, \r\nallotte<l sane $6250 per school for the \r\npurtJOse of planning its SBM/SDM \r\nl?roposal. Even ~en staffs often met \r\non their own time to develop and \r\nfurther refine their proposals. tn \r\nreflecting on Hamoond\'s School \r\nImprovemen t Pro)ect, Hamrrond E\'eder a tion \r\nof Teachers President Patrick O\'Rourke \r\nhas suggested that extra time be spent \r\nin discussing the meaning.and rationale \r\nfor snared decision-making along w~th a \r\nmore thorough regard for \r\nimplementation. Similar thOughts are \r\n\r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\nbeing echoed by teacher leaders in \r\nToledo, Rochester, New YorK, Cincinnati \r\nand Qther districts evolving new \r\ndecisiQn-mak.ing structures. In sun, \r\nrore planning time and financial \r\nresources will be helpful in effecting \r\na transition to SSM/SOM. \r\n\r\n~~la:does it take for ~to be \r\n~~P ce? ~ \r\n\r\nAlthough there appears to be no one \r\n\r\nright answer, experience tends to \r\nc9nfirm a gradual, evolutiQnary \r\napproach to implementatiQn is \r\ndesiraole. EdrIalton, Canada, perhaps \r\n\r\nthe NQrtn American school district with \r\nthe most experience in school-based \r\nmanagement, is still evolving after ten \r\nyears. This evolutionary approach, \r\nhowever, is Qften at odds wi th the \r\nAmerican penchant fQr speedy \r\napplication. In Albuquerque, \r\nsite-based budgeting was tQ oe \r\nimplemented within two years, and plans \r\nto accomplish even more encompassing \r\nmeasur.es were presumed possiole in the \r\nsame a:nount of time by the Eas t Saton \r\nRouge parish school system. Caldwell \r\nwri tes, \"Time lines have been \r\nunrealistically short, with experience \r\nto date suggesting five years lOr more \r\nare required. If (Cal~ll, 198d) This \r\nis especially so when complex issues \r\nsuch as equity in resQurce allocation \r\n\r\n(Edn\'ontQn takes into account eleven \r\nlevels Qf per pupil allocation to meet \r\nfQrty-seven categories Qf student need \r\nin determining each school\'s allQtment) \r\nlOr toe ouilding Qf trust among \r\ndecisiQn-makers, is necessary to the \r\nSIOCXJth functioning Qf the changes being \r\nuniergQne. \r\n\r\nOne Qther possibility should be noted. \r\nThe preceding discussiQn could be \r\ninterpreted as assuming the Qnly \r\nsetting fQr school-based management is \r\nthat Qf an entire school building and \r\nstaff. s,uch an interpretatiQn would be \r\n\r\nmistaken.

The 17 major recommendations in this document \r\n(starting on page 11) address the need to: \r\n\r\nA. Develop a school-based management program and implement it on a \r\nvoluntary basis as a pilot project in each of Chicago 23 elementary school \r\ndistricts. (Recommendations 1-3) \r\nB. Improve professional standards in order to attract, train, compensate, \r\nand retain the highest qualified teachers and career service professionals \r\nto work in our city\'s public school classrooms. (Recommendations 4-9) \r\nC. Reduce class size (students per class) to improve the quality of \r\ninstruction for each student, and develop a program to relieve \r\novercrowding in schools. (Recommendations 10-13) \r\nD. Improve staff development to enhance teaching skills. \r\n(Recommendations 14-15) \r\nE. Eliminate unnecessary and burdensome paperwork which steals valuable \r\ntime from the highest goal of the school system --educating children. \r\n(Recommendations 16-17) \r\nThe recommendations provide a clear path to improve the delivery of \r\neducation in the Chicago Public Schools, to regain the public\'s confidence in \r\nthe system\'s ability to provide quality education, and lay a foundation to \r\njustify the increased, stable, long-term funding from the state which the \r\n\r\nschools sorely need. \r\n\r\n-4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Chicago Teachers Union issued its first report on educational \r\nreform, entitled \"Perspective From The Classroom.\" At that time the debate in \r\nschool reform focused on legislative initiatives and the need to mandate \r\nchange in the Chicago Public Schools through law. Since that time much has \r\nhappened and some reforms have been initiated. \r\n\r\nThe debate now focuses on two broad areas of reform: shared decisionmaking \r\nand increased parent involvement. The school system needs a conscientious and \r\nthoughtful move toward restructuring the decision-making authority, greater \r\nparental involvement, more professionalization of the teaching process, and \r\nrestructuring the teaching-learning environment. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously, action must be taken to secure long-term, stable funding \r\nfor Chicago\'s public schools. \r\n\r\nChicago Teachers Union is actively working with the Chicago Board of \r\n\r\nEducation, public officials, parent and civic groups, and the business \r\ncommunity to accomplish these goals. We invite you to give careful \r\nconsideration to our recommendations and engage in the public dialogue on how \r\nto make Chicago\'s public schools the best in the nation. Together, we can \r\nbegin to accomplish this in 1988. Our goal should be no less. \r\nSincerely, \r\nJacqueline B. Vaughn \r\nPresident \r\n\r\n-5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATt LtGISLATIVt PROGRtSS ON tDUCATIONAL RtrORM \r\n\r\n\r\n-6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ« \r\n\r\nSTATE LEGISLATIVE PROGRESS ON EDUCATIONAL REFORM \r\n\r\n\r\nThe CTU\'s original Perspective From The Classroom report contained 47 \r\nspecific recommendations for educational reform aimed at legislative action. \r\nSome of these reforms were adopted by the legislature in 1985 with the \r\nparticipation Qf other concerned organizations and legislators. Among these \r\nwere acceptance of the concept of education reform as a viable means of \r\nimproving student achievement, upgrading standards for both students, \r\nteacher~, and administrators through: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ A single state teacher certification authority. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nUpgrading standards for teacher certification including written \r\nexaminations. \r\nâ€¢ A clear and fair process for evaluating and dismissing \r\nincompetent teachers which includes peer assistance and \r\nconsultation \r\nâ€¢ A state mandate requiring local school districts to have \r\nstudents tested regularly for academic proficiency throughout \r\ntheir school life. \r\nâ€¢ A state report card requiring each local school district to \r\npublicly report on student testing results and for the state to \r\npublish them to inform the public on the status of student \r\nlearning in Illinois. \r\nâ€¢ Broader state support for full-day kindergarten programs \r\nâ€¢ Giving elementary students experience \r\nin a departmentalized \r\ninstruction program. \r\nâ€¢ Extending \r\nstate authority to grant certification to school \r\nprincipals with a mandated periodic renewal. \r\nâ€¢ A comprehensive \r\nprogram t~ train administrators in evaluating \r\npersonnel. \r\n-7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO TtACHtRS UNION INITIATIVtS \r\n\r\n\r\n-8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO TtACHtRS UNION INITIATIVtS \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Teachers Union recognizes,that legislative mandates are not \r\nenough. We agree with local critics of the school system that many \r\neducational issues need to be and can be address~d within our own school \r\nsystem. As early as December, 1984 we negotiated with the Chicago Board of \r\nEducation the formation of joint CTU/school board committees which would \r\naddress four broad areas of reform: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Teacher Performance, Evaluation, and Effectiveness \r\nâ€¢ Teacher Certification, Preparation, and Recruitment \r\nâ€¢ \r\nSchool Administrator Training and Certification \r\nâ€¢ Student Expectations and Curriculum \r\nWe also continued our efforts in our negotiations with the school board on \r\nthe 1987-89 employee contract. Although there has been some willingness on \r\nthe part of board staff to discuss major reform issues, we are disappointed \r\nwith the slow pace with which the Chicago Board of Education has moved toward \r\nembracing local reform initiatives. We join with parents and the business \r\ncommunity in urging the board to move forward with planning and preparation. \r\n\r\nSOME ACCOMPLISHMENTS POINT THE WAY \r\n\r\nChicago Teachers Union and the school board have negotiated some key areas \r\nof reform. We wish to call particular attention to the following: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nThe establishment of a city-wide policy for the evaluation of \r\nregularly appointed teachers utilizing a set of standard \r\npedagogical performance objectives; principals are mandated to \r\nconduct annual reviews. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nAn agreement to develop a pilot teacher internship program in \r\nthree high schools. \r\n-9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nAn agreement to establish a peer assistance pilot program in \r\none elementary district that will pertain to all first-year, \r\nregularly appointed teachers. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nAn agreement to increase the amount of money allocated to \r\ndiscretionary funds at overcrowded schools. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nAn agreement that discussions between the principal, the school \r\nfaculty\'s professional problems committee, and the approval of \r\nthe local school improvement council will determine how \r\ndiscretionary funds are spent. \r\nâ€¢ A joint Union/Board committee to discuss and formulate a \r\nvoluntary career ladder program at the school level for \r\n\"classroom teachers \r\nwho wish to accept additional \r\nresponsibilities for the educational process at the local \r\nschool . \r\n\r\nâ€¢ A joint Union/Board committee to discuss and develop a model \r\nfor school based management, using the present local school \r\nimprovement council guidelines as a starting point . \r\nâ€¢ A new procedure for the remediation, and, if necessary, \r\ndismissal of tenured teachers identified as performing \r\nunsatisfactorily by the school administrator. The procedures \r\ninclude peer assistance and consultation, regular \r\nadministrative observation, and consultation. \r\nWe must stress that the agreements and progress noted here are but a first \r\nstep toward moving the Chicago schools along a sure and clear path of \r\neducational reform. These efforts are only the beginning of changes which \r\nmust occur in order to prepare Chicago\'s students to be qualified, competent, \r\ncompetitive adults, and able to succeed in the 21st century. \r\n\r\n-10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO TtACHtRS UNION RtCOMMtNDATIONS \r\nON \r\nDtCtNTRALIlATION AND SCHOOL GOVtRNANCt \r\n\r\n\r\n-11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS ON DECENTRALIZATION AND SCHOOL GOVERNANCE \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is clear consensus among parents, teachers, and leaders in business \r\nand government that two important issues must be addressed by those concerned \r\nwith the quality of education in this city. \r\n\r\nFirst, the present administrative bureaucracy of Chicago\'s public school \r\nsystem must be restructured and redefined, and changed and made more \r\neffective. There are calls for the dismantling of the bureaucracy and the \r\ndispersal of decision-and policy making authority from the central school \r\nboard. Some seek to divide authority into 20 or more local districts~ Others \r\nseek to divide this authority among all 600 local school councils. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Teachers Union rejects any legislative or local initiative for \r\ndecentralizing the Chicago Public Schools, but we do recognize that such \r\nproposals are an outgrowth of increasing parent and citizen frustration with \r\nthe lack of progress in our schools. We share their concerns. \r\n\r\nThe second area of agreement is that there is too little parental \r\ninvolvement in helping the local school succeed in its mission. CTU believes \r\nthat the solution to these problems can be found in the development of a \r\nprogram for shared decision-making at the local school called school-based \r\nmanagement. Such a program provides for the participation of the local school \r\ncouncil in the setting of local policy, hiring of a principal and control over \r\na budget. It provides for management of the day to day operations by teachers \r\nand the principal. The basic components of the school community would then be \r\ninvolved and have a stake in a successful educational program: locally \r\ninitiated and locally developed. \r\n\r\nWhile school-based management is a relatively new and untried process in a \r\nlarge urban setting, CTU will share research findings from programs currently \r\nunderway in urban settings with similar demographics as Chicago\'s system, such \r\nas Dade County, Florida and Hammond, Indiana. \r\n\r\n-12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe recommend that a pilot program be voluntarily established in each of \r\nChicago\'s 23 school districts as soon as possible. CTU has urged the board of \r\neducation to activate the Union/Board joint committee negotiated to develop a \r\nmodel and recommendations for operation of a school-based management program. \r\nAn effective model for school-based management should include as much of the \r\nexisting school governance and teacher contract structure as possible. \r\n\r\nWe also encourage board members, parents, and business leaders to make \r\non-site visits to these programs to assess their effectiveness. An effective \r\nschool-based management program should include: \r\n\r\n-1. An oversight committee comprised of board members, teachers \r\nand community representatives from selected schools with \r\nauthority to oversee implementation. \r\n-2. Local School Improvement Councils with expanded budgetary \r\nand administrative selection authority, as mandated. \r\n-3. A school management team to guide implementation of \r\ninstructional programs and run the school on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nChicago Teachers Union believes that open discussion will provide valuable \r\ninsight into the development of a policy for restructuring schools, and \r\nre-emphasize the need for responsible planning. Chicago must function as a \r\ntotal entity, and it cannot be governed by individuals or groups concerned \r\nonly with their own interests. The school system in this city must be \r\nrestructured and revitalized to meet the demands on the future leaders of our \r\ncity, our students. \r\n\r\nParents and educators alike must recognize that restructuring the system \r\nis only one issue facing public education in this city. In order to change \r\nthe public\'s perception of the public school system and to insure that quality \r\neducational opportunities are provided for students, Chicago\'s parents, \r\nteachers, students, civic, business, and community leaders must join this \r\neffort to reform the education process. \r\n\r\n-13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC~ICAGO TtAC~tRS UNION RtCOMMtNDATIONS \r\n\r\nON \r\n\r\nIMPROVtD PROFtSSIONAL STANDARDS AND tDUCATION \r\n\r\n-14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND EDUCATION \r\n\r\n\r\nChicago Teachers Union will work toward changing the way teachers in this \r\nschool system are involved in the educational process at the local level. We \r\nseek changes that will radically alter the industrial factory process upon \r\nwhich our schools have been modeled. There are several important problems \r\nthat deserve immediate attention. \r\n\r\nOur teaching force is growing older. We estimate that more than 1/3 and \r\nperhaps as many as 1/2 of our teachers will retire in the next five years. \r\nSimultaneously the system presently has the largest number of temporarily \r\nassigned teachers since the 1960\'s. Over 4,000 teachers are full-time \r\nsubstitutes, and during the past six months this number has been steadily \r\ngrowing. \r\n\r\nWe therefore recommend that steps be taken to recruit new teachers to the \r\nprofession, to retrain career employees and to develop an incentive program to \r\nretain qualified, enthusiastic teacher specialists. These steps should \r\ninclude: \r\n\r\n-4. Establishment of a full internship program after a model has \r\nbeen successfully tried, mutually developed and \r\ncooperatively served by area universities to assure a steady \r\nflow of good candidates as beginning teachers. \r\n-5. Establishment of a systemwide peer assistance program for \r\nprobationary first year teachers. \r\n-6. Development of a voluntary teacher/peer intervention program \r\nfor tenured teachers. \r\n\r\n-15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur school system will not be able to attract and retain career teachers \r\nwithout good salaries -competitive with comparab1~ professions and with \r\naccompanying career incentives -and without sound aggressive recruiting \r\nplans. To accomplish this we recommend: \r\n\r\n-7. \r\nA recruiting program that will track scholastically \r\nsuccessful Chicago high school graduates through their \r\ncollege careers, offering incentives to bring them back to \r\nour schools as teachers. \r\n\r\n-8. \r\nHigher starting salaries tied to rigid internship and \r\nperformance standards. \r\n\r\n-g. \r\nCareer status and salary incentives for classroom teachers \r\nthat do not depend on subordinating classroom teaching for \r\nadministrative roles. \r\n\r\nOne of the pre-eminent standards by which schools, both public and \r\nprivate, are judged is the number of students placed in each classroom. \r\nChicago\'s schools have among the highest ratio of students to teachers in this \r\nstate and this condition must be addressed. \r\n\r\nCTU will continue to seek relief through the following: \r\n\r\n.10. \r\nClass size reductions through contractual negotiations \r\ngiving special emphasis to reduced teacher-pupil ratios in \r\nelementary schools, and low achieving schools. \r\n\r\n-11. \r\nAn increase in the number of teachers who provide direct \r\nservices to children at the school site. \r\n\r\n-12. \r\nThe development of programs -supported by the Union, Board, \r\nand parents -which will more effectively utilize available \r\nclassroom space throughout the city . \r\n\r\nâ€¢13. An aggressive program of construction, rehabilitation, \r\nand/or rental of classroom units for overcrowded schools \r\nwithout space. \r\n-16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImproving the overall instructional process and quality of instruction is \r\nof prime importance. In addition to developing programs and salary schedules \r\nwhich will attract good teachers we must devise ways to provide professional \r\ngrowth and to utilize edu~ationa1 research to improve classroom instruction. \r\nAdequate time must be provided to teachers for preparation. Unnecessary \r\npaperwork, which detracts from instructional efforts, must be eliminated. \r\n\r\nWe therefore recommend: \r\n\r\n-14. \r\nThe development of a system wide staff development program \r\nguided by and planned in consultation with teachers to \r\nprovide direct, on-site experience and utilization of \r\nupdated techniques. \r\n\r\n-15. \r\nThe initiation of teacher-trainer techniques developed \r\nthrough the American Federation of Teachers Educational \r\nResearch and Dissemination program in each of our 23 \r\nelementary and high school districts. \r\n\r\n-16. \r\nThe elimination of unnecessary, duplicative or frivolous \r\npaperwork which takes valuable time away from classroom \r\ninstruction. \r\n\r\n-17. \r\nThe review and approval of administratively-initiated \r\nrecordkeeping above the school level by a joint committee of \r\nteachers and local administrators. \r\n\r\n-17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Teachers Union\'s vision of the future of the teaching \r\nprofession is one that depicts a system that attracts new, enthusiastic, \r\nhighly-trained college graduates. They will work with career teachers and \r\nparaprofessionals who are actively involved with day-to-day decisions relative \r\nto work with students. All teachers will be treated and paid as \r\nprofessionals. And, as professionals, they will perform and accept \r\nresponsibility as professionals. \r\n\r\nWe envision a system with educational workers who care about the system \r\nand a system that has the active involvement of parents of students, concerned \r\ncivic, business, and community leaders. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Teachers Union\'s recommendations will help achieve such a \r\nsystem, one where the participants noted above can support our efforts to \r\nupgrade standards for students, improve conditions for school employees, and \r\nwho are willing to find a permanent source of revenue to support a \r\nrestructured, revitalized system of public education in Chicago. \r\n\r\nJBV:JGK:MJH \r\nopeiu-28-yv \r\n\r\n-18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),(6188,24,2,49,0,'Education'),(6189,24,2,41,0,'The Teachers in Hammond, IN, expand their role in the school improvement process.'),(6190,24,2,39,0,'Hammond Federation of Teachers'),(6191,24,2,48,0,'Hammond Federation of Teachers, .

In \r\n1985 the union and the district negotiated \r\nan agreement by which teachers, on a \r\nschool-by-school basis, may set aside elements \r\nof their contract in order to implement \r\nschool improvement plans. \r\n\r\nAlthough the improvement process is \r\nstill in its early stages, one indication of \r\nsuccess is the change in roles and attitudes \r\nevident among the participants. \r\nBoth the union president and the district \r\nsuperintendent remark that each side is \r\nmoving away from the adversarial stance \r\nthat has characterized the traditional relationship \r\nbetween labor and management \r\nand toward a more cooperative approach \r\nthat better serves the interests of \r\nall parties. Although significant numbers \r\nof principals and teachers continue to resist \r\nchange, many others support the SIP \r\nand say that it has enhanced their roles \r\nas professionals. Parents say that the SIP \r\nhas opened a new channel of communication \r\nfor them and offers a way to become \r\nactively involved in their children\'s \r\nschools. Students acquire new leadership \r\n\r\nskills through the SIP and are able to assume \r\ngreater responsibilities for their \r\nown learning ;md for the success of programs \r\nin their schools. \r\n\r\nTHE SIP IN HAMMOND \r\n\r\nParticipants in the School Improvement \r\nProcess in Hammond define it as a building-\r\nbased method of managing schools \r\nthat can lead to significant improvements \r\nin the quality of education. Though the \r\nprocess has been implemented districtwide, \r\nteachers and administrators emphasize \r\nthat decision making remains schoolbased. \r\nThis is in keeping with their belief \r\nthat those most closely affected by decisions \r\nshould have a major role in making \r\nthem and that reforms are most effective \r\nwhen carried out by people who \r\nfeel a sense of ownership of them. The \r\nSIP is completely compatible with the \r\ncollective bargaining process; in fact, by \r\ninvolving teachers in making decisions \r\nabout policy, the SIP actually strength~ \r\nens the bargaining process, according to \r\nPatrick O\'Rourke, president of the Hammond \r\nTeachers\' Federation. \r\n\r\nIn planning the improvement process, \r\nparticipants identify certain key elements \r\nthat are necessary if the SIP is to be effective. \r\nAmong these ingredients are such \r\nthings as training, time, money; ongoing \r\ndistrict support, and access to current or \r\nstate-of-the-art information on which to \r\nbase decisions. \r\n\r\nThe city of Hammond, with a population \r\nof about 100,000, is in the northwestern \r\ntip of Indiana, sandwiched between \r\nGary, Indiana, and the Chicago \r\nmetropolitan area.

The Hammond \r\nschool district is the eighth largest \r\nschool corporation in Indiana and employs \r\nmore than 1,600 people, of whom \r\nabout 900 are teachers and 70 are administrators. \r\nThere are 25 schools in \r\nthe district: four high schools, two middle \r\nschools, and 19 elementary schools. \r\nStudent enrollment -which declined by \r\n3% between 1983 and 1984 -is now \r\nmore than 13,000. Achievement test \r\nscores have shown steady improvement \r\nin the district since 1984. Overall results \r\nof the spring 1986 testing program \r\nshowed that students in 11 of the 12 \r\ngrades scored at or above national norms. \r\n\r\nLike many urban school district\" across \r\nthe country, Hammond has had its share \r\nof financial problems. In 1985 the district \r\nfaced a $2 million budget deficit, \r\nwhich was projected to increase to $7 \r\nmillion. Since then, however, that deficit \r\nhas been reduced to half a million dollars. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis feat was accomplished through the \r\ncooperative efforts of the school board, \r\nthe administration, the teachers, the parents, \r\nand other community members. A \r\nteam representing these groups met with \r\nstate authorities to discuss solutions to \r\nthe district\'s financial problems. Through \r\na variety of measures -fund transfers, \r\npayment of late bills with bonds, and reductions \r\nin administrative and teaching \r\nstaff through attrition -.the deficit was \r\nlowered \"without closing one neighborhood \r\nschool and without eviscerating any \r\n\r\n\r\n.\"\r\n\r\nâ€¢â€¢ -\'~ <, .....\r\n\r\n\", t .~.r~~~\'. \r\n\r\neducational programs, and we still managed \r\nto award competitive.~ raises,\" \r\nboasts Hammond Superili~~~t David \r\n\r\nDickson.;:;:?}:\"\" \r\n\r\nA sense of camaradene:aDa\'ti\'ust has \r\nhelped facilitate the Schoof~vement \r\nProcess. The SIP started as a pilot project \r\nin 1982 in Hammond High School, \r\nwhich was once a top-ranked school in \r\nthe state but which had been in continuous \r\ndecline since the early 19708. Academic \r\nachievement had slipped dramatically, \r\nwhile the rates of absences and \r\ndropping out were rising. Racial tensions, \r\nvandalism, drug abuse, and fighting \r\nin the halls were rampant. Teacher \r\nmorale was at an all-time low, and the \r\nlevel ofhostility between teachers and administrators \r\nwas mounting. \r\n\r\nInitial costs for the Hammond High pilot \r\nproject were underwritten by the Eli \r\nLilly Endowment, the Institute for the \r\n\r\n; Development of Educational Activities \r\n\r\n~. (part of the Charles Kettering Founda\r\n\r\n\r\n\'. tion), the Hammond school district, and \r\n\r\nthe\' Indiana Criminal Justice Institute. \r\nThrough the efforts of a school improvement \r\ncommittee composed of teachers, \r\nadministrators, parents, students, and \r\ncommunity members, Hammond High \r\nachieved a remarkable turnaround in a \r\n~o-year period. Several measures proposed \r\nby the committee led to visible improvements: \r\nless vandalism and graffiti, \r\nincreased attendance, higher levels of student \r\nachievement, and a dramatic reduction \r\nin student failures. \r\n\r\nShortly after the experiment at Hammond \r\nHigh, two elementary/middle \r\nschools also became involved in the SIP. \r\nIn 1984, after the successful experiences \r\nat the three pilot schools, the process was \r\nextended to the remaining 22 schools in \r\nthe district; \r\n\r\nTHE SIP TODAY \r\n\r\nThe implementation of the SIP has \r\nnot been unifonn throughout the district. \r\nThis is understandable because each \r\n\r\n, school adapts the process to its own particular \r\nculture and \'changes at its own \r\npace. While some schools are developing \r\nprograms that signal a \"gradual yet \r\nfundamental shift in the decision-making \r\nauthority, others have simply put in place \r\nthe mechanisms for change and conducted \r\nthe initial training,\" O\'Rourke ob\r\n\r\n\r\n--served. \r\nThe mechanisms for change at each \r\nschool include an improvement committee \r\nof 15 to 20 members, including, \r\n\r\nteachers. administrators, parents, students, \r\nand, when possible, other community \r\nmembers. The agenda for the improvement \r\nprocess is set by a smaller \r\ncore team ...:. usually consisting of the \r\nprincipal, one or two teachers from the \r\nlarger SIP team, and a parent. The principal \r\nmay also serve on the larger SIP \r\nteam or may occasionally attend the SIP \r\nmeetings, when. for instance, information \r\non the school budget may directly \r\naffect the committee\'s work. Although \r\nHammond school representatives have \r\nmade it a point not to set any rigid rules \r\nconcerning SIP committee membership \r\nor meeting times and procedures, there \r\nis one rule to which all teams are expected \r\nto adhere: a principal should never \r\nchair the SIP committee, because this \r\nwould merely perpetuate the traditional \r\ntop-down approach to school management. \r\n\r\n\r\nGary Phillips, a consultant who was \r\nwith the Kettering Foundation when the \r\npilot project began, continues to provide \r\nsome technical assistance to the \r\nschool district. But the major responsibility \r\nfor training staff and for overseeing \r\nother SIP activities has been assumed \r\nby Wayne Pechers, who in 1985 was appointed \r\nby the district superintendent as \r\ncoordinator for the SIP. \r\n\r\nPechers conducts the initial training \r\nworkshop when a school first becomes \r\ninvolved in the SIP. Then, in the traditional \r\n\"train-the-trainer\" approach, individuals \r\nwho have completed Pechers\' \r\nworkshop train others in the school community. \r\nThe initial training improves participants\' \r\nskills in consensus building, \r\nbrainstorming, creative problem solving, \r\nand group dynamics. In addition, Pechers \r\nand Jane Kendrick, principal of Eggers \r\nElementary/Middle School and a leading \r\n\r\n\r\n\'771t\' I,n .hlem \\\\\'j(h Ihese average report \r\n(,(Iftis 1\\\'. it\'s hurd 10 get them \r\nfundedÂ· \r\n\r\nadvocate of the SIP, have conducted ongoing \r\nworkshops in leadership skills for \r\nprincipals and for SIP committee chairs. \r\n\"Several principals are still uncomfortable \r\nin their new roles because they feel \r\nthey have lost power. What we\'ve tried \r\nto do is convince them that their power \r\nis strengthened since the policies implemented \r\nhave the full sUPPQrt of the \r\nfaculty,\" said Pechers. \r\n\r\nFor example, one elementary school \r\nwas struggling to improve itself but its \r\nattempts to do so had been thwarted by \r\nmistrust and hostility between the faculty \r\nmembers and the principal. At a faculty \r\nmeeting. Pechers introduced consensus \r\nbuilding in small groups and the use of \r\nbrainstorming techniques. What might \r\nhave been just another gripe session \r\nturned into a productive meeting at which \r\nthe teachers and the principal at least \r\nagreed about some of the barriers to \r\nchange and about ways to try to overcome \r\nthem. \r\n\r\nPechers, who is also a math teacher at \r\nHammond High School, is able to continue \r\nin his teaching duties at full salary \r\nbecause he has been granted \"half-time \r\nrelease\" by the central administration to \r\ncarry out his SIP responsibilities. He also \r\nreceives a small stipend for his SIP work. , \r\n\r\nAfter the initial training at a school has \r\nbeen completed, the SIP team\'s first task \r\nis to develop a \"vision of excellence\" a \r\nstatement of what the team members \r\nwant to achieve in five or 10 years. Specific \r\nlong-and short-range goals and priorities \r\nare determined, and then a strategic \r\nimprovement plan is developed. Often, \r\nthe teams go on weekend retreats to \r\na peaceful setting far removed from the \r\nschool environment to develop their vision \r\nand start work on an improvement \r\nplan. \r\n\r\nA key component of the SIP is the \r\nconcept of \"pyramiding,\" which, when \r\ndone properly, increases the number of \r\npeople who have input into decision making \r\nand thus increases the acceptance of \r\nnew programs and policies. Pyramiding \r\nrequires that each member of the SIP \r\nteam interact regularly with five to seven \r\npeers. This interaction consists of \r\ncommunicating information about the \r\nteam\'s work or about a specific proposal \r\nand gathering feedback from interested \r\nparties who are not members of the team. \r\nEach member of the initial group of five \r\nto seven individuals is then expected to \r\nreach a similar number of people, who, \r\nin turn. contact others. In this way, a significant \r\nportion of the school population \r\n\r\nJANUARY 1988 \r\n\r\n\'. \r\n\r\n\r\ncan be reached in a relatively short time. \r\nThe success of pyramiding varies from \r\nschool to school and depends on how \r\nwell the teams are organized and on the \r\nschool\'s level of commitment to the improvement \r\nprocess. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the grant money received \r\nfrom the Lilly Endowment and the Kettering \r\nFoundation, in 1986 the Hammond \r\nschool district, largely through the efforts \r\nof Jane Kendrick, received a $50,000 \r\ngrant from the Indiana State Department \r\nof Education to provide incentives for \r\nteachers to participate in the School Improvement \r\nProcess. This money, which \r\nhas been allocated among the various \r\nschools, can be used for whatever purposes \r\nthe SIP committee chooses, including \r\ntravel expenses for weekend retreats, \r\nfor special training sessions or conferences, \r\nfor visits to other schools experimenting \r\nwith new ideas, and for visits \r\nto universities where research related to \r\nschool improvement is being conducted. \r\nSome SIP teams have used the money to \r\npay for substitute teachers so that the \r\nteachers on the SIP team could spend \r\nmore time participating in school improvement \r\nactivities. \r\n\r\nIn 1987 the Hammond School District \r\nwas awarded a $66,000 grant from the \r\nFederal Mediation and Conciliation Service. \r\nThe money will be used for additional \r\npersonnel to help coordinate SIP \r\nactivities and train participants and for \r\nsponsoring other events, including two \r\nlabor/management conferences for principals \r\nand teachers during the school \r\nyear. \r\n\r\nTime is a resource as p~iousas money. \r\nAnd time has been provided by the \r\ncentral administration of the Hammond \r\nschool district. SIP teams can request \r\nreleased time in order to meet during the \r\nschool day. Each team decides when and \r\nhow often it needs to meet. Depending \r\non the workload, some teams may meet \r\nmonthly or weekly -either on their own \r\ntime or, if their requests for released \r\ntime have been approved, during school \r\nhours. Some teams that need extended \r\nblocks of time have worked out arrangements \r\nwhereby team members combine \r\ntheir own free time with the released time \r\ngranted by the district. \r\n\r\nTIlE SIP AND THE UNION \r\n\r\nDuring the early stages of the SIP, the \r\nHammond Teachers\' Federation was not \r\ndirectly involved. However, several individual \r\nmembers and union leaders \r\n\r\n\r\nPHI DELTA KAPPAN \r\n\r\nincluding O\'Rourke, who was also a \r\nmember of the Hammond High School \r\nSIP committee -were active participants. \r\n\"Our feeling during those early \r\nstages was that, with only three schools \r\ninvolved as pilots, we could monitor the \r\ndevelopment of the SIP and intervene as \r\nan institution at the proper time, should \r\nwe feel threatened,\" said O\'Rourke. That \r\nattitude changed in 1985 as it became \r\nincreasingly obvious to union leaders, \r\nbuilding representatives, and rank-andfile \r\nmembers that shared decision making \r\nin the local schools could complicate \r\nthe process ofcollective bargaining. \r\nMore and more schools were considering \r\nprograms, such as peer evaluation, \r\nthat clearly deviated from contractual \r\nprocedures. \r\n\r\nFor the union, the SIP represented both \r\na threat and an opportunity. On the one \r\nhand, the prospect of teachers, parents, \r\nadministrators, and students working together \r\nto implement programs at individual \r\nschools \"seemed to threaten the \r\nvery institutional balance of power that \r\nexisted within the district,\" according to \r\nO\'Rourke. On the other hand, this new \r\nmodel of shared governance was a way \r\nto give teachers the opportunity to develop \r\nprograms and policies and thus \r\nbroaden their scope as professionals. \"We \r\nconcluded that it was possible to move \r\nin this direction by working within the \r\ntraditional collective bargaining process, \r\nwhile simultaneously developing new relationships \r\nwith management that go beyond \r\nbargaining,\" O\'Rourke said. \r\n\r\nIn September 1985 the union negotiated \r\na three-year contract with the school \r\nboard that endorses the SIP and includes \r\nlanguage pennitting local schools to deviate \r\nfrom the master contract in order to \r\npursue their improvement plans -providing \r\na specific procedure is followed. \r\nO\'Rourke believes that the language of \r\nthe contract frees individual teachers at \r\neach school to make decisions without \r\nunion interference and without weakening \r\nthe union contract. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe procedure for deviating from the \r\ncontract is fairly complex, and I will only \r\noutline it here. Briefly, all faculty members \r\nat a school must reach a consensus \r\non a proposed program. The faculty as \r\na body then determines a time period not \r\nto exceed one school year -for a \r\ntrial test of the program. Criteria are \r\nestablished by the faculty to evaluate the \r\nprogram at the Cii~ of the trial period. \r\nThe faculty then rates the proposal on a \r\nscale of zero to five, with a five indicating \r\nenthusiastic endorsement of the limited \r\ntrial test and zero indicating strong \r\nopposition to even a limited trial test. \r\nIfthe procedure is followed correctly, the \r\nunion does not have the right to file a \r\ngrievance alleging that a school improvement \r\nproject violates any contract provision; \r\nhowever, an individual teacher \r\nmay still file a grievance in his or her own \r\n\r\nname. . \r\n\r\nAt one elementary school, where an innovative, \r\ncross-grade-Ievel reading program \r\ncreated through the SIP has dramatically \r\nimproved student reading levels \r\nand eased teachers\' workloads, the faculty \r\nmembers followed the procedure because \r\nthe program required teaching arrangements \r\nthat violated certain work rules \r\nspelled out in the contract. \"The procedure \r\nallowed us to meet our individual \r\nneeds at this school,\" said one teacher, \r\n\"without making a blanket statement for \r\nall the schools.\" \r\n\r\nIn general, union involvement in the \r\nSIP has boosted teacher support. \"It has \r\nconvinced many teachers,\" Pechers said, \r\n\"that the SIP is not simply another fad, \r\nbut something that is here to stay.\" \r\nO\'Rourke, who has used general meetings \r\nof the union as a vehicle for \"selling\" \r\nthe SIP and informing members of \r\nits programs, estimates that today about \r\none-third of the teachers are actively participating \r\nin the School Improvement \r\nProcess, while the remaining two-thirds \r\nare equally divided among the skeptics \r\nand those who take a \"wait-and-see\" attitude. \r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPORT FROM THE TOP \r\n\r\nDavid Dickson, the superintendent of \r\nschools, says that his job has become \r\neasier since the SIP came to Hammond. \r\nBecause teachers, parents, and principals \r\ntake part in the decision-making process, \r\nthe traditional mistrust and negative feelings \r\ntoward the central administration \r\nhave been significantly reduced. \"There\'s \r\nbetter communication, and the pool of ex\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.. \r\n\r\n\r\npertise has beeit broadened,\" said Dick-\r\n\r\nson. A strong profession\r\n\r\n\r\nal . . teachers, \r\n\r\n. should \r\n\r\nin such \r\n. areas as \r\n\r\nstructional strategies, \r\n\r\npolicies, and he has honored most dec \r\n\r\nsions reached by the SIP teams. \r\n\r\nAlthough he has been in his present po\r\n\r\n\r\nsition only since 1985, both teachers and \r\n\r\nprincipals view Dickson as instrumental \r\n\r\nin mobilizing the support of school board \r\n\r\nmembers for the SIP. Today, three \r\n\r\nschool board members are active mem\r\n\r\n\r\nbers of SIP teams. Jane Kendrick says \r\n\r\nthat Dickson\'s leadership style has al\r\n\r\n\r\nlowed the SIP to grow by \"letting the \r\n\r\nprincipal and the faculty run their school \r\n\r\nwithout interference from the central office \r\n... \r\n\r\nPerhaps the most tangible demonstration \r\nof district support for the SIP has \r\nbeen the provision of released time so that \r\nthe SIP teams can meet. Recently, however, \r\nsome SIP teams have had their requests \r\nfor released time denied by the \r\ncentral administration, because certain \r\nstate rules mandate the number of days \r\nstudents must be in the schools and the \r\nnumber of hours and minutes thev must \r\nspend in the classroom. Dickson is committed \r\nto challenging such rules -many \r\nof whil\'h he considers educationally unsound \r\n-and. together with the union\'s \r\nOÂ·Rourke. he is developing measures that \r\nwill permit SIP teams to adjust school \r\nschedules to allow adequate time to meet \r\n\r\nInside the Schools \r\n\r\n\r\niALTHOUGH THE Ham\r\n\r\n\r\n. mond School Improvement \r\nProcess (SIP) was imple. \r\n\r\n\r\nmented districtwide only \r\n\r\nthree years ago, several \r\nSIP committees have already made impressive \r\nstrides in curriculum reform. the \r\nimprovement ofteaching techniques, new \r\nhiring strategies. and other areas. Some \r\nof the SIP-related achievements at the \r\nlocal schools are noted below. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ At Lafayette Elementary School, a \r\ntransitional first-grade/kindergarten program \r\nwas created for youngsters who \r\nexperienced difficulty in kindergarten \r\nand needed more preparation before entering \r\nfirst grade. The program, which \r\nwas researched, reviewed, and designed \r\nby teachers and administrators working \r\nclosely with parents, represents a major \r\ndeparture from the established curriculum. \r\nTeachers also say that they are actively \r\ninvolved in detertnining personnel \r\nneeds, scheduling. student placement, \r\ncurriculum development, and the selection \r\nof textbooks. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Meanwhile, at Eggers Elementary/ \r\nMiddle School. teaching techniques and \r\ninstruction have been enriched through \r\nthe adoption of state-of-theÂ·art methods \r\nthat address the individualized learning \r\nstyles of students. Other accomplishments \r\nrelated to the SIP include: the \r\nadoption of a course schedule in which \r\nthe time slots for various subjects are rotated \r\nevery 12 weeks in order to accommodate \r\nthe needs ofboth morning learners \r\nand afternoon learners; the develop-\r\nI \r\n\r\n\r\nment of a reading center fur teaching! \r\nacross grade levels: and the receipt of a \r\n$20,000 middle-school recognition award \r\nfrom the Lilly Endowment to plan and \r\n\r\ncarry out further improvement activities. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ At Hammond High School, where. \r\nthe first pilot program was conducted, \r\nthe SIP team screened and interviewed \r\ncandidates for the principal\'s position \r\nand made recommendations to the district \r\nsuperintendent and the school board. \r\nFour other schools have followed suit, \r\nwith teams of teachers. administrators, \r\nstudents, and parents interviewing and â€¢ \r\nranking candidates, In all five cases, the\' \r\nfinal choices of the SIP teams were approved \r\nby the central administration. \r\nâ€¢ At Morton Elementary School, the \r\nteachers and administrators have agreed \' \r\ninformally to a peer evaluation program. \r\nPending further study, the model could. \r\nbe a,dopted at other schools. \' \r\nâ€¢ At Kenwood Elementary School, ; \r\nan innovative, cross-grade-Ievel reading\' \r\nprogram was created through the SIP. \' \r\nThe pn\'gram, which restructure.s the \r\ndailv ~chedulc to guarantee 90 mmutes \r\nof u\'ntntcrrupted time for reading instruction, \r\nha, dramatically improved student \r\nreading Ie\\ els and at the same time eased \r\ntcachc~~\' v,nrkloads. \r\nâ€¢ ,~.!\'Il .It Hammond High School. a \r\n\\.Â·(la\\.Â·hll1~ Illcntnr program. which require\' \r\nthe ,Â·(l,lpt.\'ration of the central admini\"\r\nrat\'lln. the huildinl! administrators. \r\nami the .lllccÂ·ted tl\'acher~. pairs seasoned \r\ncarl\'C\'r tl\'ac\'hcr~ \\\\ ith new teachers who \r\nare c\'\\IX\'rrc\'n(in~ dlftil.\'ulties. -JCL \r\nand plan their activities. \"Any loss of \r\nschool days.\" Dickson said, \"is far outweighed \r\nby the advantages of the SIP: \r\nimproved curriculum, more creative instructional \r\nstrategies, and a positive \r\neducational climate.\" \r\n\r\nBecause the SIP has been in place districtwide \r\nonly since 1984, representatives \r\nof the Hammond school district say that \r\nit is too early to evaluate its impact on \r\ndistrictwide trends in achievement test \r\nscores, attendance rates, and other iildi~ \r\ncators of student performance. Based on \r\nthe programs developed thus far, the \r\nimpact on attitudes, and the changes in \r\nteacher/administrator roles and relation~ \r\nships, the School Improvement Process \r\nhas clearly made a difference in the Hammond \r\nschool district and will continue to \r\ndo so in the future, say SIP participants. \r\n\"We have a process in place that will enable \r\nchange to occur. And all things are \r\npossible,\" O\'Rourke stated. . \r\n\r\nO\'Rourke\'s optimism, however. is tempered \r\nby his knowledge of the forces that \r\nwork against school improvement. The \r\nexistence of federal and state laws that \r\nlimit the effectiveness of the SIP is one \r\nobvious factor, and teacher cynicism is \r\nanother. Less obvious, however, is the \r\ndeparture of key leaders who have been \r\nstrong advocates of shared decision making \r\nand school improvement. And in \r\nschool districts -where leadership \r\nchanges occur regularly -this becomes_ \r\nan especially important factor. \r\n\r\nAt Hammond High School, the school \r\nimprovement process has lost some of its \r\nmomentum since its early days. While \r\nseveral factors undoubtedly combined to \r\nac\\.\'Ount for this, several members of the \r\nschool community believe that the departure \r\nof Elizabeth Ennis, a principal who \r\nwas committed to the SIP, was a major \r\none. Nonetheless, even the loss of a . \r\n~trong leader can be viewed as but a temporary \r\nsetback. \r\n\r\nToday there are signs that the School \r\n\r\nImprnvement Process at Hammond High \r\n\r\ni~ heing revived. An alternative mathe\r\n\r\n\r\nIllatil.\'s program, conceived and designed \r\n\r\nhy teachers. was recentlv\' introduced \r\n\r\nthere. The program relies \'on such non\r\n\r\n\r\ntraJitional methods as small-group in\r\n\r\n\r\n~tructi\\ln. peer tutoring. and team teach\r\n\r\n\r\nIn\\!. Students advance according to their \r\n\r\nrn;~tery of the subject matter rather than \r\n\r\na-:cnrding to time spent. Said Wayne \r\n\r\nPcchers. \"We got lazy.

I thought we\'d go back to \r\nsomething very basic--your own classroom. If you were empowered \r\nto change one or two or three things in your school, if you \r\ncould go back from here and say \"this is going to happen \r\ntomorrow\" or \"this is something that I would like to change,\" \r\nwhat would you change, and why? \r\n\r\nMarsba Osborne: I\'m Marsha Osborne from Brevard County, \r\nFlorida, and I teach children with learning disabilities. I\'ve \r\nbeen teaching for six years in the school system and had \r\npreschool experience before that. The thing I would like to see \r\nus get to do is more time to share ideas. I am also the local \r\nsite coordinator [AFT\'Â£ Educational and Reasearch Dissemination \r\nproject] of our district and I see the excitement that comes \r\nout of these sessions. That\'s the most important thing that we \r\nhave is our experiences, and we don\'t get to share those. Here \r\nwe are in our own little cubicles trying to recreate this wheel, \r\ndoing all this trial and error, and the lady two doors down has \r\nalready found a solution to that problem, and we\'re missing it. \r\n\r\nRoger Glass: When you say more time to share ideas, would it \r\n\r\nbe your suggestion then that some time specifically be \r\n\r\ndesignated when teachers could get together on some formal \r\n\r\nbasis? \r\n\r\nOsborne: Yes, I would like to see that. I don\'t have an \r\n\r\nexact format in mind, and I know some of these things cost \r\n\r\nmoney, but we spend a lot of time quote \"being inserviced\" and \r\n[it\'s] the old thing about an expert is anyone who lives more \r\n\r\nthan 30 miles away â€¢â€¢â€¢well, you know some of the experts live \r\n\r\nnext door, and we don\'t get any of their expertise. The premise \r\n\r\nof the ER&D program is that we share the latest research \r\n\r\ninformation. If we can\'t get the infdrmation about the latest \r\n\r\nresearch directly from the researchers, then we can share ways \r\n\r\nof implementing that research. We\'ve taken the best of both \r\n\r\nworlds--we\'ve got the research, the theory and then the \r\n\r\npractical [experience]. \r\n\r\nRochelle Hutcherson: I\'m Rochelle Hutcherson from the Newark \r\nschool system. I am a basic skiQls teacher--that\'s a pullout \r\nprogram. I\'ve been teaching 18 years. I would restructure the \r\nschool. When you restructure, a teacher has more input into how \r\nthe school is run, from curriculum all the way down to where \r\nyour students are going to next year. I\'ve found that in \r\nNewark, because everything is mandated from some hierarchy or \r\nsome other group and it\'s filtered down to us and we have no \r\ninput into it, that the scores are low and yet we are held \r\naccountable for everything that happens in the district. But we \r\n\r\n\r\n\'. \r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question 1: Empowerment/2 \r\n\r\nhave no input into how to solve the problem. I would go right \r\ninto my school tomorrow, and start restructuring â€¢.â€¢ but very \r\nslowly. I wouldn\'t go back and just hit the teachers with this \r\nbrand-new reform, because the teachers just can\'t make that \r\nadjustment right away. Give it to us a little at a time. I \r\nbelieve in peer review, but let\'s start with quality circles or \r\na group to talk about what our problems are and see if we can \r\nhelp each other one to one. I really am for the reform of \r\nrestructuring the schools, but over a period of time more than \r\njust three months. Give us a long prescription, a year or two, \r\nand I think we could pull it off. \r\n\r\nGorman: Would there be anyone thing that you would start \r\n\r\nwith? Obviously you can\'t\'restructure the [entire] school at \r\n\r\nonce. ~~\"\"\" \r\n\r\ncROCh:i~. Yes, I would develop a different communication \r\nbase with my administration. Instead of the principal dictating \r\nthese things to us, we would discuss itâ€¢â€¢.make us an equal â€¢â€¢â€¢ an \r\nequal communications basis. That\'s where I would start. \r\n\r\nBasil Thomas: I\'m Basil Thomas from the Houston Federation \r\nof Teachers. I teach for the Houston Independent School District \r\nin Houston, Texas. My subject matter is correlated language \r\narts for seniors--that\'s a non-college-bound English course. I \r\nhave taught in secondary schools for 35 years and two years of \r\ncollege teaching for a total of 37 years. I also am a site \r\ncoordinator for ER&D. \r\n\r\nIf I went back and looked in my classroom, the first thing I \r\nwould change would involve the curriculum, some of the elements \r\nin the curriculum and some of the sequencing of that \r\ncurriculum--the time frame for those elements. I agree with you \r\n[motioning to Marsha Osborne] to have informal symposium time \r\nwhere teachers could get together and share things that work. \r\nAs a result of this ER&D program in our building, we have a lot \r\nof teachers who have benefited from it already arid we do share \r\none on one, but we miss an opportunity some time to continue to \r\nshare it. \r\n\r\nI dOislike and am angry about mandates. I dislike being \r\nordered. Now, I realize that you can have polite commands \r\n[laughter] â€¢â€¢â€¢ \"please do this, would you do this,\" but just the \r\nformation of \"this needs to be done, could we talk about it?\" is \r\na whole lot better than \"you shall do this at this time.\" The \r\nmandates I find difficult to work with. Since I work with \r\nseniors, I try to eliminate mandates to them, since they also \r\nfound them difficult to work with. Now, the polite requests are \r\nstill necessities, but it makes the difference. \r\n\r\nGlass and Gorman: What are examples of those mandates? And \r\n\r\nfrom whom? \r\n\r\nThomas: All right. Let\'s say, \"You will have your lesson \r\n\r\nplans in by noon Friday.\" \r\n\r\nGlass: Is that a mandate from the principal or the school \r\ndistrict? \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question 1: Empowerment/3 \r\n\r\nTho_as: From the principal. Now the district does require \r\nlesson plans. The time at which they are in is left up to the \r\nschool. If you do not have them in, this will be tabulated and \r\nrecorded and documented and used in Domain Five on your \r\nassessment, which is a downward evaluation and poses a threat, \r\nwhich I object to because no one stays on lesson plans. I think \r\nyou need some sort of goal, I thoroughly approve of objectives \r\nas to what you wish to accomplish within your time frame. But \r\nno one stays on them, and if one is late, that doesn\'t mean you \r\ndon\'t have one. We have experienced teachers in our building, \r\nand they have more lesson plans in their heads than you could \r\nwrite out if you spent a year writing them out. They know what \r\nthey\'re doing â€¢â€¢â€¢ \r\n\r\nAs to the reforms, I guess I\'m a revolutionary, and have \r\nbeen somewhat lucky. I think I\'m in charge of my classroom, and \r\nso I take charge of it and I teach in charge of it. But as we \r\nbecome more and more mandated, I am running into more and more \r\nfriction, and I do think teachers should be in charge of \r\nteaching. \r\n\r\nIn the course of all of this, two things have come about \r\nthat I think are a little unique in Texas, maybe not in other \r\nareas, but certainly in Houston. This year is the first time \r\nthat faculty members--myself and a couple of other people--have \r\nbeen included on the agenda of the faculty meeting to conduct \r\nthe meeting. We have conducted two or three meetings this \r\nyear. We have been consulted even when not involved in the \r\nmeeting on the agenda and have been asked to be a resource \r\nperson to help solve problems--problems might not be the right \r\nword--but if a teacher has a weakness, to help her--or \r\nhe--strenthen skills before it becomes a problem. We have been \r\nasked to be used as a resource person to avoid problems. And I \r\nthink this is part of teachers being in charge of teaching arid, \r\nin a way, I think it\'s a little takeover of some of the old \r\nground that administrators had. \r\n\r\nBoger Glass: How \r\ndid that come about? \r\n--::-r.-: piA sh \'1 \r\n\r\nThomas: I\'mq;; ) jng\'. [Laughter] It\'s something that has \r\noccurred just in my school. It comes from the ER&D linkers and \r\nactivities in my school. This has come as an outgrowth of ER&D. \r\n\r\nJim Threinen: I\'m Jim Threinen and I\'m from Robbinsdale, \r\nMinnesota. I teach in the Technology, Learning Campus, which is \r\na state technology demonstration site. It\'s a middle school \r\nwith 300 students and 14 full-time teaching staff. I have \r\ntaught 30 years, almost all in the science area. \r\n\r\nI have to explain a little bit before I answer the question \r\n\"if empowered for change, what would I do?\" Technology Learning \r\nCampus is the outgrowth of an infusion of funds by the state \r\nbecause they believed three years ago that technology would be a \r\nwelcome addition to the tools of instruction and they wanted to \r\nknow what was good and what was bad. So they established a \r\nnumber of demonstration sites, two of which were schools. The \r\nschool was started new, very much like the Saturn project. \r\n\r\n\r\n.. \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question 1: Empowerment/4 \r\n\r\nThere was no new building; they simply rented 14 rooms from the \r\n\r\ncommunity center, renovated them and asked the union for the \r\n\r\nright to have teachers volunteer for the first year and thereby \r\n\r\nbypass the voluntary pool. This was and is the only exception \r\n\r\nto the master contract that was necessary. \r\n\r\nNow we have participatory management; we have control of \r\nperformance review, we have control of staff development and \r\ncontrol of curriculum and we have the time available for it. It \r\ncosts $1,100 more per student--this is for the cost of more \r\nplanning time, more full-time teacher equivalents, either as \r\nteachers or as paraprofessionals, and the technology is \r\nexpensive. \r\n\r\nSo I\'m in the best of all worlds. But what I would do if \r\nempowered to change is, after being here, I\'d like to get staff \r\nelsewhere in our district to be more aware of and more \r\ninterested in change, because ..â€¢â€¢ it is interesting â€¢â€¢â€¢ any student \r\ncan be admitted to our school, and yet we do not have a waiting \r\nlist. Any staff member could have volunteered, and yet we \r\nfilled two positions from the involuntary pool. Yet I think \r\nit\'s the best of all worlds, and the teachers who are there \r\nthink it\'s the best of all worlds. We have an outreach program \r\nwhere we bring people from the rest of the district and they all \r\nleave saying, \"God, this is great,\" and that\'s the last we hear \r\nfrom them. \r\n\r\nThe imperative for change is not evident in our district, \r\nand I would like to build the need for the imperative for \r\nchange. But the fact of the matter is â€¢.. and I\'m a little \r\nfrightened by this whole thing. If I could use the parallel: We \r\nare used to being sort of gardeners, with a rake and a hoe and \r\nsome seeds from last year and a little bit of old-fashioned \r\nfertilizer and growing some crops that have been adequate until \r\nrecently ..â€¢.I read A Nation at Risk and we read the AFT\'s \"The \r\nRevolution that is Overdue\" and the Carnegie report--a bit \r\nsmugly--but we read it [laughter], and we were prepared for a \r\ngreen revolution that might bring a rototiller and a front \r\nloader and some hybrid seeds and maybe some chemicals. We \r\nturned around and, my God, there was a bulldozer, an earth mover \r\nand plants we\'ve never seen before. And all that we recognize is \r\nthat there\'s still a little bit of old-fashioned fertilizer \r\nmixed in there. \r\n\r\nWe are overwhelmed--at least I am overwhelmed--by the \r\nmagnitude of the task, because to see that task, you have to \r\nback up and look at this nation as a whole, and I\'ve had the \r\nopportunity to do that. Mary [Granger] in Alabama telling me \r\nstories â€¢.â€¢my God, I wouldn\'t even be in teaching, there\'s no way \r\nI\'d be in teaching in Alabama. And then I get the stories from \r\nLouisiana and Utah, and I am absolutely apalled . .â€¢. \r\n\r\nSo the imperative for change is the first thing I\'d try to \r\nget out there, and secondly, I\'d like to see something like I\'m \r\nin now continue. It\'s sundown this year. The state has decided \r\nthat the \"student at risk\" is first priority, so my monies are \r\ngone. We\'ll be absorbed back into the voluntary pool; I\'ll do \r\nall right. But I see now that ER&D needs to be part of our \r\nteaching centers. \r\n\r\nI see \\pOW that there is a tremendous need to share the \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question 1: Empowerment/5 \r\n\r\nvision. I see now that it\'s a national problem. I really fear \r\n\r\nthat the teachers in the district I come from may not be ready \r\n\r\nto assume the role that is expected of them. I\'m glad I will \r\n\r\nonly report to the leadership, and I\'m not an officer â€¢â€¢.â€¢ I\'m not \r\nsure they\'ve abandoned the tradition of killing the messenger \r\nwhen the news is bad [laughter]--I would hate to be the one to \r\n\r\nstand up and advocate, as [Albert] Shanker has courageously \r\ndone, a change on all these different levels: admission, \r\ncertification, instructional leaders, which means governance, \r\ndecision making, our relationship with the business community, \r\nour relationship with the taxpayers. But if I had the money to \r\ndo it and the time to do it, I guess I would like to share the \r\n\r\nvision and do more than just talk a good story, because I think \r\nwe need some people to go out and prosyletize this time. \r\n\r\nThis conference has done one thing â€¢â€¢. profoundly convinced me \r\nthat national need is far greater than any of us in Minnesota \r\nneed. \r\n\r\nRoger Glass: I want to ask you something about this \r\nparticipatory management. Why is that better? \r\n\r\nThreinen: It\'s a difficult thing to analyze. Minnesota is \r\na state that has a tradition of support for education. We never \r\nreally ran into the situation that would bring about \r\nrevolution. We had a few benevolent dictators and monarchs, but \r\nalways we were there for the long haul and they were on their \r\nway through. It\'s very hard for me to analyze why we are where \r\nwe ar.e and others are where they are. I don\'t know. I only \r\nknow that the tradition for supporting education in Minnesota is \r\nvery strong â€¢â€¢. in our legislature, the last thing they cut is \r\neducation and the first thing they restore is education. We \r\nhappen to be in economically distressed areas, which means they \r\ncan\'t do great things like raise us all to $60,000, but I am \r\nconfident that if they could, they would. I think we .have the \r\none thing that seems to be missing around this nation--we trust \r\nthat our citizens really believe that our most precious resource \r\n\r\nis our children. And we have a tradition to support that. \r\n\r\nThomas: Which the rest of us don\'t have. \r\n\r\nThreinen: But why not? That\'s why I\'ve been taking my long \r\nwalks [at Airlie]. Why not? Where did that come from? If \r\nsomebody could sort that out for me ...I feel terribly \r\nuncomfortable, almost guilty, about coming from Minnesota. \r\n\r\nDeanna Woods: I think it has something to do with the fact \r\nthat we\'re over 200 years old as a nation and we\'ve got about \r\nhalf a million fads and people have seen too many things fail. \r\nThe problem has been in the process of developing those fads and \r\ngoing through them is that we\'ve done them wrong. It\'s time \r\nthat we stopped that process and we start doing everything \r\nright. \r\n\r\nThreinen: But it\'s far better to try to do something and \r\nmaybe do part of it wrong than it is to do nothing. \r\n\r\n\r\nAir1ie interview/Question 1: Empowerment/6 \r\n\r\nMarsha Osborne: Part of the problem is that we\'ve started \r\n\r\nout to do so many things and God knows we\'ve had good \r\n\r\nintentions. We\'ve started that Saturn project â€¢..how long have \r\n\r\nthey spent planning that thing? \r\n\r\nTbreinen: They haven\'t even produced the car yet! \r\n\r\nWoods: That\'s okay, they\'re taking the time; they\'re working \r\nout every detail. \r\n\r\nThreinen: Well, I\'m not going to buy the first one, I\'ll \r\ntell you that. [Laughter] \r\n\r\nOsborne: We don\'t think things through carefully enough. \r\nOh, I pray that this works â€¢â€¢â€¢ you don\'t know how much I\'m \r\ndepending that this really comes off. There\'s a part of me that \r\nreally is frightened. If we blow this one, we\'re done. We\'ve \r\ngot this Carnegie Foundation, we\'ve got all the right people \r\nsaying all the right things, the things we want to hear; we all \r\nbelieve that this needs to happen. Now if we go at this the way \r\nwe\'ve gone at everything e1se â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ I just see everybody out there \r\nsaying \"we\'ve got this momentum now, we can\'t lose it,\" but \r\nwe\'ve got to make sure that we do this right. It\'s like \r\nRochelle said earlier, we\'ve got to do this very, very slowly. \r\nYes we\'ve got to keep the momentum, but if we just go through \r\nthis and do change just for the sake of change â€¢â€¢.. \r\n\r\nWoods: That ties in with what I am concerned about. \r\n\r\nInterviewers: Wait, can you introduce yourself? \r\n\r\nWoods: Let me make my statement, and then I\'ll introduce \r\nmyself, before I forget this! [Laughter] What I\'ve seen in the \r\n\r\n19 years that I\'ve been a teacher is a number of component parts \r\nof what we\'re proposing now and when those component parts have \r\nbeen designed by the people who are the experts, the solvers, \r\nwho have the knowledge and the skills and the expertise to do \r\nit, they did it right and all those compenent parts worked and \r\nthey worked right. The trouble is, we\'ve never put all those \r\nthings together, and I want a package of reform~. I don\'t want \r\nto do it \"this way\" this year and \"this way\" next year without \r\nhaving it all part of a large plan. \r\n\r\nOkay, my name is Deanna Woods [laughter] and I teach at \r\nWilson High School in Portland, Oregon. I teach high school \r\nEnglish, and I\'ve taught at alll levels, freshmen through \r\nseniors, extremely accelerated college-bound advanced placement \r\nstudents ..â€¢ and the slow ones. As I said before, I\'ve been in \r\nthe district 19 years, and the thing that saddens me is after \r\nseeing all the fads come and go, and all the excitement build up \r\nand fall again and watch something fade away, I go back after \r\nthis week into a situation that is actually worse than when I \r\nstarted 19 years ago. It has not gotten any better, and it\'s \r\ntime that we did something right. If I were to go back to my \r\nschool and find myself empowered, one of the first things I \r\nwould do is form one of those Saturn groups, because I\'ve seen \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question 1: Empowerment/7 \r\n\r\nsomething like that happen before in the school where I worked \r\npreviously. We had one and it worked for 10 years, and it was \r\nwithin the department I was in--English--so I would establish a \r\nSaturn group and I would start talking about what we could do to \r\nget rid of those things or modify those things that keep us from \r\ndoing the job that we want to do, whi ch is t.each. That\'s the \r\nbottom line. We walk into the classroom, we see those human \r\nbeings that we want to work with, and there are all those \r\ninterruptions--the people pounding on the door, the kids on the \r\nfire escape going \"whoops\" all the time you\'re holding a \r\ndiscussion, the class next door, which is separated only by a \r\nthin door, which is drama, and they\'re fighting the battle of \r\nBaton Rouge or something; the books that are never there in \r\nsufficient quantity--all of those things--you can\'t find a \r\ncounselor to talk about a student you\'re very concerned about \r\nbecause she or he is very busy with five or six hundred other \r\nstudents, and your schedules don\'t match. All those things \r\nshould have been solved years ago, and aren\'t. There are the \r\nsame ones that I found 19 years ago, and they can be solved, \r\nbecause I\'ve seen some of that kind of thing happen. \r\n\r\nNow, there are all other kinds of things. I\'ve spent five \r\nyears of my \'life reading all the reform reports .â€¢.what I\'ve \r\nlearned is that if you put these things together, there are \r\nways, I repeat, of solving the problem. I\'ve watched top \r\nquality teachers come; they get discouraged and leave. I don\'t \r\nwant that to happen anymore. I\'ve watched children enter those \r\nclassrooms and get discouraged and leave. I don\'t want that to \r\nhappen anymore. I want to see that as a union, we spread the \r\nword about these things â€¢.. how they can work, how they actually \r\napply to the classroom and that the excitement that we get in \r\nteaching is something that we can maintain. This is a necessary \r\ncost. I\'m coming to the point where I\'m afraid, too, that if we \r\ndon\'t do something now and do it right, that this is the last \r\nopportunity we\'ll ever have. \r\n\r\nThreinen: We are at the teachable moment. \r\n\r\nWoods: That\'s right. \r\n\r\nThreinen: Let\'s do\' it. \r\n\r\nBasil Thomas: May I make a statement? [Gesturing to Jim \r\nThreinen] I really think that what you\'ve said in Minnesota is \r\nthe basis of this whole reform--that your legislature and your \r\ncitizens firmly believe in the value of education--that a key \r\nissue in all of these reports, that you believe in the value of \r\neducation, and not just a little song and dance number or lip \r\nservice that our children are our main resources, but an actual \r\nrealization that they ARE the only resource that needs \r\ncontinuing and 100 percent of our concentration ..â€¢â€¢ \r\n\r\nJulie Hess: I\'m Julie Hess of the Toledo, Ohio, schools. My \r\n\r\nfirst 11 years of teaching were all in the primary grades, and \r\n\r\nthe last 15 years I have been a teacher consultant for \r\nelementary teachers in our voluntary assistance peer program. \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question 1: Empowerment/8 \r\n\r\nSo my response is probably going to be a bit broader based. \r\nComing from Toledo, I guess we are very fortunate, because we \r\nhave so many things in place that are already being talked about \r\nat this conference, what is being suggested to be done. We have \r\nthem. We have hardly an area or subject in the school sytem \r\nwhere there is not teacher input into the decision--curriculum, \r\nstaff development, school policy such as discipline, I mean, we \r\nare everywhere. Our teachers have the right to be there and \r\nthey are appointed through the union. \r\n\r\nTherefore I guess my response would be that I would never \r\nwant our staff to take this for granted. It is a right that \r\nthey have earned--it has really given them a large step toward \r\nbeing professional, of being autonomous. That does not mean \r\nthat there are not needs and problems to deal with ...â€¢certainly \r\nthe issue of class size is still there. One of the [other] \r\ngreat needs that exists is one-to-one tutoring for the child \r\nthat is having difficulty. It is not always the child that is \r\npulled out for the compensatory programs but the child perhaps \r\ndoesn\'t qualify. We have pretty good planning time, but I still \r\nthink that that is something that is underestimated and needs to \r\nbe looked at--a chance for people to get together and plan and \r\nshare their ideas. \r\n\r\nRoger Glass: You said that teachers in Toledo \"earned\" the \r\n\r\nright to participate. What did you mean by \"earned?\" \r\nHess: They had been through a couple of \r\nembarassing school closings because of lack \r\nthrough a time when education was valued \r\nwhere your mouth is .â€¢. this kind of thing. \r\nstrikes and \r\nof money. \r\nbut you don\'t \r\nThrough our \r\nWe \r\nput \r\nwent \r\nmoney \r\n\r\nnegotiation process, through job action, through collective \r\nbargaining, through the things that one has to go through to \r\ngain certain rights. We\'ve been through that. \r\n\r\nGlass: Do administrators recognize that by giving teachers \r\nthe right to be more participatory that it\'s helped the whole \r\nschool system? \r\n\r\nHess: Yes and no. For some administraotrs who are still \r\nconcerned with power or who might have been someone who didn\'t \r\nteach very long themselves and really wanted out of the \r\nclassroom or perhaps was not a good teacher, they might have \r\nsome difficulty with it. It would depend on the specific area \r\nor the particular administrator. OneÂ· administrator told me very \r\nemphatically before I left for the conference, \"You make sure \r\nyou tell them down there that this is one administrator who \r\nbelieves that the union has to be involved in school reform.\" \r\nEven with this kind of cooperation that we now have, you \r\nshouldn\'t be naive to think that you still don\'t get into \r\nadversarial positions. You do, and you deal with them \r\nacccordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\n,..., \r\nAirliue interview/Question 2: colleagues/l \r\n\r\nTRISH GORMAN: I want to follow up on something somebody said and \r\nthat is sort of our second question. Now that you\'ve \r\ntransformed your schools, what about your fellow teachers? A \r\nlot of teachers complain about how terrible things are, and yet \r\nwhen you start talking about big changes, they get very nervous. \r\nThey say it\'s too risky, it\'s too much responsibility, it~s not \r\nmy job, the union is getting in over its head. Think about your \r\ncolleagues back in the classroom--how would they react to this, \r\nand how would you go about convincing them that this is the \r\nright way to go? \r\n\r\nWOODS: Actually, returning to Wilson [her high school], I found \r\n\r\nthat sometimes it just takes somebody willing to say, \"Okay, \r\nwe\'re sick of this situation and we know we can do something \r\nabout it.\" You start with a process and build onto it. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: In my area, if I returned with the reform, it would \r\ndepend on my marketing skills. You know your leaders because \r\nyou\'ve been there so long, and you go to your leaders and you \r\npromote this and they buy into it. When they buy into it they \r\nsell it to someone else and eventually you become a group of \r\nstrong people who are willing to change the system. You must \r\nunderstand, we know what it\'s like there. We all are \r\nuncomfortable for one reason or another, so therefore you don\'t \r\nneed a sledge hammer, but you have to [do it] slowly. You can\'t \r\ncome in there and say, \"Okay, we\'re going to turn this whole \r\n\r\nthing upside down and start over again.\" \r\nif you take it slowly and you use your myou can pull it off. \r\nThat won\'t sell. \r\narketing skills, I \r\nBut \r\nthink \r\nWOODS: You have to be good teachers â€¢â€¢â€¢ of adults. \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: Yes. If people have faith â€¢â€¢â€¢ your peers ... like we said \r\nthis morning, we know who the good teachers are. No one has to \r\ncome and tell us who the good teachers are, because you can tell \r\nby the way their classes walk down the hall, by the way they \r\nspeak to children. I\'m a firm believer that if we try to take \r\nthis back out to the public and if we push too hard, I\'m afraid \r\nwe\'re going to turn everybody off. I\'m a firm believer in \r\nworking from within the system. We\'ve got a lot of things about \r\neducation that are right. I\'m very proud of my school; I think \r\nwe have an excellent faculty and an excellent administrator. I \r\nhear some people talking about their administrators, and he does \r\nnot do some of the things to ~eachers that others do. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: That\'s true, incidentally of most teachers who are \r\npolled â€¢.â€¢â€¢ They actually like their administrators. \r\n\r\n\r\nr \r\n\r\nAirli~e interview/Question 2: colleagues/2 \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: Right. I think we have to build on what\'s going \r\nright. He does include us in some of the decision-making \r\nprocesses. He asks for our opinions. As long as schools are a \r\nteam â€¢â€¢â€¢he gets 110 percent out of us. He knows how to handle \r\npeople. But I\'m sensitive to those people who don\'t come from \r\nthose kinds of environments. You have to find out where you are \r\nand work for change from within the system. If we try to come \r\nin and throw the baby out with the bath water, change everything \r\nat once, we\'re going to get nowhere â€¢ \r\n\r\n. HUTCHERSON: I also think you have to customize your \r\n\r\nrestructuring. There are administrators who are excellent and \r\n\r\nthat you really want to involve in your restructuring process~ \r\n\r\nbut there are other administrators whom you want to manage \r\n\r\npaperwork and things like that â€¢â€¢â€¢. if you\'re allowed to do \r\n\r\nitâ€¢â€¢â€¢ now that we\'re talking about reform and anything goes. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Earlier I mentioned the growth process, and if I took \r\n\r\nthis changing the school, and I\'ll use the word change rather \r\n\r\nthan restructure, my faculty would by and large be in favor of \r\n\r\nit. Of course we\'ve already started a slight--or maybe not so \r\n\r\nslight--revolution in my school. We decided two years ago--we \r\n\r\nbeing the teachers--that if we were doormats, we really couldn\'t \r\n\r\nblame other people if they walked on us. So, we have stopped \r\n\r\nbeing doormats, and that is probably one of the reasons that \r\n\r\nmembership in HFT is three-fifths [of faculty] in my building, \r\n\r\nthat it\'s that high. It\'s seeking to improve our own \r\n\r\nself-image, self respect, [that] we have developed attitudes of \r\n\r\nself-worth, which teachers need to be aware of. \r\n\r\nI have gone to administrators and pointed out to them--which \r\n\r\nfortunately they have bought~-that if all of us do well on the \r\n\r\nassessments and do various good things, they look better, our \r\n\r\nschool looks better. The reason for their salary and our salary \r\n\r\nis student achievement. If we can show that, we\'re in a much \r\n\r\nbetter position. \r\n\r\nI\'m getting ready to drop a little hand grenade on them--our \r\n\r\nschool in tests results has moved up four points. And while \r\n\r\nthey really aren\'t giving the teachers and the dissemination \r\n\r\n[ER&D] program credit for that, I\'m going to point out that \r\n\r\nthree-fifths of our faculty is involved in some benefit from \r\n\r\nresearch dissemination. Therefore, that four-point growth, \r\n\r\nwhile it isn\'t a tremendous amount, is a beginning and has been \r\n\r\nenough to call attention to our school downtown. I think since \r\n\r\nit is a growth process, my faculty would very much be in favor \r\n\r\nof change--now not throw the entire thing out, but certainly \r\n\r\nchange, modify, restructure, as long as it were in a growth \r\n\r\nprocess. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: If I could press a little on this â€¢â€¢â€¢. some of the \r\ncomments that we had from the field indicate there is still \r\nreluctance about change, that there are many teachers who just \r\nwant to go to work [or say] \"just let me alone, I don\'t want all \r\nthese crazy changes, I don\'t want to work these extra hours for \r\nextra money, I like the way it\'s struct-ared now.\" How do you \r\n\r\n\r\nAirli~e interview/Question 2: colleagues/3 \r\n\r\nrespond to that? Or, first of all, do you think that that\'s not \r\n\r\ntrue [and] that most people really do want change? \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Speaking for those in my building, we would rather not \r\n\r\nhave to do it. But rather than continue with the current or \r\n\r\npresent condition, we are willing to do it and see a need to do \r\n\r\nit. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: What if it would mean, though, changing hours? What if \r\n\r\nit would mean changing time off in the summer? \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: My answer is the same. We would rather not have to go \r\n\r\nthrough the effort, but the present system is working to a point \r\n\r\nbut it is not working to either the administration\'s complete \r\n\r\nsatisfaction or to our complete satisfaction. So to have the \r\n\r\ninput and the control, our building would be willing to do it. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: I\'m saying something different. Increasing my day \r\nor increasing my year will not necessarily make this a better \r\nprogram~ what I\'m saying is give me a chance to help change what \r\nI have right now, without those increases. Research says that ~ \r\nan increased day or increased year has not made anything better. \r\nI want to go through other changes before I add to my day or add \r\non to my year. Let me go in and be apart of the decision \r\nmaking, and if that doesn\'t work, then I\'ll reconsider. \r\n\r\nAnd to the gentleman from Minnesota [gesturing to Jim \r\nThreinen] â€¢â€¢â€¢ I want for my system what you say you have for your \r\nsystem. That\'s why we want reform and change. We want what you \r\nhave. You were saying why don\'t other districts have it.â€¢â€¢â€¢ The \r\nmoney isn\'t there, we have poor economic conditions .â€¢â€¢â€¢ \r\n\r\nTHREINEN: It\'s won\'t be there for us, either. That\'s why we\'re \r\n\r\nenvying Toledo [laughter]. Theirs looks permanent. \r\n\r\nHESS: I think you\'re right about the marketing. It depends on \r\nwhat idea you\'re pursuing~ you don\'t pursue an idea just to \r\npursue it. Some of the things that we have came out of real \r\nproblems and needs that existed before education reform was even \r\nbeing talked about. In order for some of this to occur, you \r\nhave to survey teachers, you have to have committees, because \r\nhow is one going to want to be part of decision making if they \r\nare never given the opportunity and training to do it. Our \r\nteachers now have been in decision making for so long that if \r\nthe administration does not follow the process, they will not \r\nuse or do what comes out of the committee that has not followed \r\nthe procedure. They are that far along, because they have had \r\nseveral years of being involved in decision making. \r\n\r\nSomtimes you may have to do something in a \"pilot\" manner, \r\ntry it out. ~ It depends on what you are pursuing. Just to \r\npursue reform for reform in of itself won\'t be successful. \r\n\r\nWOODS: We\'ve got to remember that we\'re not working in a \r\nvacuum. We may want to avoid change within our schools, but the \r\nproblem is that there are things going on outside of ttS. Our \r\neconomy and our society is changing on us, and the children \r\nwe\'re serving are changing. We have to address those very real \r\n\r\n\r\nAir1ife interview/Question 2: co11eagues/4 \r\n\r\nand changing needs, and the schools we have now are not equipped \r\nto do that. That\'s the reason we talk about restructuring. \r\n\r\nHESS: I also think sometimes you have to have the guts to stand \r\n\r\nup â€¢â€¢â€¢ your key people who are the 1eaders â€¢â€¢â€¢ in front of your \r\n\r\npeople and say, \"You\'re going to have to consider this,\" you\'ve \r\n\r\ngot to have the courage to do it. You might get the tomatoes \r\n\r\nthrown at you, but you\'re not a leader if you can\'t do it. \r\n\r\nTHREINEN: You talk about your~19 years [gesturing to Deanna \r\nWoods]. One has to fight cynicism and paranoia in this \r\nbusiness. I say if you\'ve been teaching 10 years and you\'re not \r\nparanoid, you don\'t understand [laughter]. The ER&D model is a \r\nsound model and the way to proceed. We took vo1unteers--high \r\ncredibi1ity--and we gave them information on the needs, \r\nresearch, and set up the mechanism for dissemination. What we \r\nhave to make very c1ear--it\'s what Al Shanker talked about--if \r\nyou wan\'t more salary, it means we must professionalize. If you \r\nwant job satisfaction, you have to get higher status. On the \r\nnegative side, the plight of education means privatization. Now \r\nif we can get those points a~ross, I think the movement will \r\nbegin, albeit slowly. Once it starts--2.3 million teachers are \r\nan incredible mass with an incredible inertia--there are no \r\nschool boards, there are no legislatures that can withstand it. \r\n\r\nWe\'ve seen it. \r\nWOODS: And we have to stop expecting overnight success. \r\nTHREINEN: \r\nlong time \r\nbasically \r\nneed some \r\nIt has been said that 10 years in education is not \r\nperiod.

There has been \r\ncriticism about the quality of those coming in. What do you \r\nthink of the suggestion--although it\'s more than a suggestion \r\nnow--the Carnegie forum has established a committee to develop a \r\nnational test. What are the things that are needed to improve \r\nteacher preparation, or is it even true that teachers coming in \r\ntoday are not prepared as well as they should be? \r\n\r\nGORMAN: And what was your experience in your own teacher \r\n\r\npreparation? \r\n\r\nWOODS: Close to abysmal. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: What was that an answer to? \r\n\r\nWOODS: Are teachers prepared today? Were they prepared 19 years \r\nago? Nineteen years ago it was close to abysmal. Now it\'s a \r\nlittle bit better. I was on a college evaluation team and had \r\nan opportunity to look very closely at what was going on, and \r\nwhat I discovered was--and to be fair I also looked at the \r\nresumes for two other universities that train students--that the \r\nvast majority of the people, if they had any K-12 experience at \r\nall, have had it 20 years ago. These are people who are \r\nsupposedly teaching classroom management skills, and they are \r\nteaching out of outdated and incomplete books. \r\n\r\nThere was a survey given and finally a conference given for \r\nbeginning teachers one year after they had begun their teaching \r\nexperience, and they were asked \"How effective was your \r\ntraining?\" They said some parts of it were very good, but the \r\npractical stuff was missing. They didn\'t know how to deal with \r\nthe parents, they didn\'t know how to deal with their colleagues \r\nor their principals effectively, and they were not prepared to \r\ndeal with discipline problems in the classroom. \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: And yet we\'ve got this model in place that tells them \r\nabout â€¢â€¢. you talk about the stuff that was outdated â€¢â€¢.well the \r\nER&D--I hate to keep harping about ER&D--but this was my thing. \r\nWe\'ve got this model in place, and very often the establishment, \r\nsimply because it\'s a union program, feels threatened by it, by \r\nthe ER&D program. Why in heaven\'s name could they possibly feel \r\nthreatened by this program, whose wnole premise is simply to \r\ngive you the latest research information and let you share how \r\nto implement it? So the bottom line is that they are afraid \r\nthat we\'re going to get everyone in a room and use it as a gripe \r\nsession. They\'re threatened also by the fact that it is a \r\ntremendous organizing tool. It is the only reason why I\'m in \r\nthe union today. I\'m a real team player. And yet this is the \r\ncomplaint we get from teachers, that we don\'t have enough \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/ Questions 3~: preparation ea~i!=J~..\"1~a\"\"~1/2 \r\n\r\npractical â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢Everyone whose ever been involved in the program \r\n\r\nhas said how fantastic it is, and yet we\'re not allowed to use \r\n\r\nit to the extent that we could to achieve the gains that we \r\n\r\nought to. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: When I went to my guidance counselor in high school, \r\nshe helped me decide to go into teaching because she said, well, \r\ntry the armed servies--that\'s what they told the boys--or \r\nnursing or secretary. I mean, black people were channelled into \r\ncertain areas. I was going to school and teaching happened to \r\nbe a professional area â€¢â€¢. so we opted for ..â€¢very bright students \r\nwent into teaching because of the direction we were sent. \r\nConsequently, we burned down a couple of \r\ncitiesâ€¢â€¢â€¢ [laughter] â€¢â€¢â€¢ take that off [the record]! We\'ve had \r\nchanges over the years and had an opportunity to go into other \r\nareas. Some of the brightest people are going into business and \r\nother areas, and the leftover folk are going into teaching, and \r\nI\'m not so sure the quality â€¢â€¢â€¢ or the preparation â€¢â€¢. is there. \r\nI\'m not sure where to put the blame. \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: I don\'t think we should be placing blame. \r\n\r\nWOODS: Let\'s talk about what we can do to improve it. \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: I think education was created by a lot of well-meaning \r\npeople who thought they were doing the right thing at the time. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: I\'m dealing from a black perspective. We were sent \r\ncertain places, we were channelled into this particular \r\nprofession. So it didn\'t matter how bright you were, you were \r\njust sent into this area. Now some people knew different and \r\nwent other places, but as it stands now, the business world has \r\nopened up for black people, all these other worlds have opened \r\nup, all these fancy words that we didn\'t know anything about. \r\nI\'m not sure who\'s going into teaching now and I\'m not sure also \r\nif the criteria is high enough for teaching as it is for some of \r\nthese other areas. I do think we should raise the level of \r\neducation and the course of study, and the evaluation process. \r\nThat\'s one of the reforms. \r\n\r\nGLASS: Wouldn\'t this national test be one way of addressing the \r\ncriteria question? Like a board ... like what a law student would \r\ntake? \r\n\r\nTHREINEN: Has it produced better lawyers? I\'ll turn the \r\nquestion back on you. I disagree with the premise. I think that \r\nperhaps we should rest our case on the fact that the law \r\nprofession has tried it, and it has not necessarily produced \r\nbetter lawyers--certainly not more ethical ones. \r\n\r\nI believe that this AFT task force report is, in this \r\nparticular case, correct. The fact that it\'s incomplete is to \r\nour benefit. Perhaps we should let the colleges teach that part \r\nof teaching which is the science, the subject matter. We trust \r\nthey have professional standards there and \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/ Questions 3 ...: preparation ens euaitl&lIlten/3 \r\n\r\nthat they will not let go through the net students who are \r\n\r\ninadequate. But, the art is ours, and they should come through \r\nour teaching centers and our schools to receive from us who are \r\nÂ·here the components of that art, to practice that art and to be \r\n\r\nevaluated on it, and if we do not certify them, they are not \r\n\r\nthere. That\'s where we lack the power in teaching. We have \r\n\r\nlots of bright people who are basket cases in this profession \r\n\r\nbecause they have the science; they do not have the art, for \r\n\r\nwhatever reason. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: So the national test isn\'t going to solve that problem? \r\n\r\nTHREINEN: No, it isn\'t going to solve that problem. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Would you allow me--without a battle--to change a word? \r\n\r\nInstead of the word art, the craft of teaching. And I would \r\n\r\nagree with you almost straight down the line. \r\n\r\nTHREINEN: See me after my long walk. [Laughter] \r\n\r\nGORMAN: But you have to have somethin.g objective. \r\n\r\nTHREINEN: Yes, and I think those we do have. \r\n\r\nGLASS: Such as? \r\n\r\nTHREINEN: In teaching, one of the things that is important is \r\nthat you take the techniques and bring the subject alive. If \r\nyou can\'t, you\'ll hear the heads thump in regular rhythym as you \r\nstart to convey the body of knowledge. There are techniques for \r\nmeeting learning styles. There are techniques for ensuring that \r\ncareer awareness is there. There are techniques for \r\ndemonstrating to students that there is a technique for \r\nsearching out information. There are ways of challenging the \r\ngifted and talented, and there are ways of achieving learner \r\noutcome. All of these are within the realm of instruction that \r\nare known to people who are staff today, who are in the \r\nprofession. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: I would disagree again. Techniques, yes, as taught, \r\nbut again, a craftsman is a skilled worker who loves his work, \r\nand if you want me to be a mechanic and use my hands on the \r\nmachinery, I can do that, and I can study the techniques, and \r\nyour car won\'t run and I\'ll have to. go to the hospital to have \r\nmy hands repaired, because I\'m awkward with machinery. And yet \r\nyou can give me a piece of clay, and I can come out with \r\nsomething. Whether or not it\'s art, I\'m not sure, but I can \r\nproduce, through a technique and a certain .amount of skill and \r\nlove or dedication, something of value. Of course, a technique \r\nthat is just a technique has no life. A craftsman is not a \r\nmachine, nor is he a dead person. But an artist is great \r\ntalent, applied craft. If we are to be assessed as teachers, \r\nthere\'s no way to assess artistry, and whether or not it is art \r\nis purely a subjective thing in whoever views you are assesses \r\nyou. But certainly on the other hand you are valid--we don\'t \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/ Questions 3 c::=t: preparation aRe aHa\'\" 11/4 \r\n\r\nwant these heads to be thumping. Whether you use technique or \r\ncraft, it\'s a matter of semantics. But the heads must stay up: \r\nthere must be interest in the activity going on both from the \r\nstudent and the instructor. If you don\'t have that, it\'s a \r\nwaste of everyone\'s time. But you do have to objectively \r\n\r\nevaluate in some manner what you are doing, and art, talent, \r\ncannot be measured. You have it, you don\'t have it. But craft \r\ncan be measured and can produce results. \r\nTHREINEN: Would you consider ER&D a craft. \r\nTHOMAS: I consider a lot of it craft, yes sir. Now I do not \r\n\r\nconsider it a dead technique. It is a procedure, but not a \r\n\r\nuniform pattern. You [gesturing to Hutcherson] have used \r\n\r\ncustomizing, which is individualizing it to your own particular \r\n\r\nstyle. Now I don\'t consider style a talent. It\'s that ability \r\n\r\nto put together what works well, is efficient for you and looks \r\n\r\ngood on you, if you want to keep it in the realm of clothing. \r\n\r\nThe same in the classroomâ€¢â€¢â€¢you can put together a variety of \r\n\r\nprocedures, some of which I may totally ignore, but we can come \r\n\r\nup with end results that are measurable and the same. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: Suppose the test was just one part? \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Which test? \r\n\r\nGORMAN: All right â€¢â€¢â€¢ a new, national examâ€¢â€¢â€¢ but it\'s only one \r\npiece of what I think the reform thing is, which is internships \r\nor some thing like that. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: The national test has a lot of problem with states \r\ngiving up the right to educate, so we\'re involved here in a \r\n~olitical issue as well as an educational issue. I still think \r\nteachers should be in charge of teaching. I do agree that \r\nteachers should have a broad-based, general education--four \r\ncomplete years--before they ever enter a college of education. \r\nI disagree on trusting colleges of education, because there have \r\nbeen inequities of any number of things that went on. My \r\nstudents change, and I have to continually see if what I am \r\nproducing is what I have set out to produce or accomplish. But \r\nI do think that at the end of that college of education, there \r\nshould be an exit test, and before they are certified, I do \r\nthink very firmly there should be an internship. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: What was your first year of teaching like? \r\n\r\n, \r\n\r\nTHREINEN: They threw me the keys and said, \"It\'s room 2271\" \r\n[Laughter] \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Mine was different. I had six years of college, two \r\nyears of education, a year and a half of internship, and that \r\nwas over 30 years ago. It just happened that I was assigned as \r\na student teacher to a teacher, and the college insisted that we \r\nstay with our supervising teacher for the length of time that \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/ Questions 3 11m: preparation n 7 7 pti sn/5 \r\n\r\nsupervisor thought was necessary to get all the information \r\nabout the subject. It wasn\'t a reflection that you were slow or \r\nfast. I was luckyâ€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ I had not only the kids in the classroom, \r\nI had awareness of school boards, a little knowledge of taxes \r\nand a lot of knowledge of how very special every parent\'s child \r\nin the classroom was and they couldn\'t possibly not have \r\naccomplished what you wanted! [laughter] \r\n\r\nHESS: If I could pick up on teacher preparation: There is a \r\n\r\nreal need for training in [classroom] management, which we are \r\n\r\nlocally trying to plug in the ER&D [program] with the two \r\n\r\nuniversities. We are having difficulty doing this â€¢.â€¢ I\'m sure \r\n\r\nthis is the turf question that comes up. But there is a real \r\n\r\nneed--we surveyed teachers. Also, for a lot of people in the \r\n\r\nclassroom, they don\'t know how to plan, they don\'t know how to \r\n\r\norganize. That may not sound like much if you\'re a planner and \r\n\r\nan organizer, but it does make a difference. \r\n\r\nI think we need to get back to the point where those who are \r\ntraining teachers at the college level have to themselves been \r\nin the classroom. I think we\'ve gone through a period of time \r\nwhere we\'ve had incoming teachers who have been trained by \r\ncollege people who have not been in the classroom or who have \r\nspent a very short time [there]. We have to have an ongoing \r\nexchange at the college level and the local level, because they \r\nneed to know from us what worked and what didn\'t in the \r\ntraining. A dialogue has to be there. They need to set up more \r\nlaboratory settings. \r\n\r\nWOODS: I advocate specifically the teacher testing. I believe \r\nin the national board because â€¢â€¢â€¢ I like Plato, I agree with him \r\nthat you need some kind of standard, some measure by which you \r\ncan judge what you\'re doing. Now in 1979, NeATE (check \r\ninitials), which was supposed to set standards for a large \r\nnumber of colleges, had a self-assessment done, and the \r\nassessment said that their standards were so low it was worse \r\nthan having no standards at all. So, educators themselves were \r\nsetting extremely low standards. Our people were going from \r\nthose teacher training colleges into baths of fire. It\'s a \r\nmiracle they stayed there. Now they don\'t have to stay there~ \r\nthat\'another thing we have to concern ourselves with. \r\n\r\nNow the schools I referred to before were not all total \r\nfailures. People went in there and said, \"Yes, I was prepared \r\nin a lot of different ways for my classroom,\" but the point is \r\nthat for years we\'ve had the tools, ,the instruments, the \r\nresearch, the experience to m~e it better, and we haven\'t done \r\nthat. We share a certain amount of guilt for that~ \r\n\r\nHESS: I think, too, that we\'re at a point where we\'re going to \r\nhave to give it a chance to see whether it does makes any \r\ndifference, ensuring that you have the correct teacher input so \r\nthat it\'s put together correctly, so that it is monitored, and \r\nthat it isn\'t just one component. \r\n\r\nWOODS: We can learn from the mistakes of the legal profession \r\nand the medical profession. We can learn from the mistakes of \r\nthe past. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to \r\nrepeat it. \r\n\r\n\r\ni J o,.J \"vJuJr\'~ \r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question\'S: Pay schemeo//l â€¢ \r\n\r\nI\' \r\n\r\nGORMAN: The next question is a tough one for us as a union. \r\nThere\'s a lot of pressure in states and some districts for \r\nteachers to accept pay schemes that are based on some sort of \r\nmerit rating or career ladder or at least differentiates. \r\nObviously, some schemes are really quite bad. But overall, \r\nthere\'s an idea out there, and I want to hear what you think \r\nabout it. Is it a loser--obviously it depends on how you phrase \r\nit--or it is something that is necessary to keep teachers in the \r\nclassroomâ€¢â€¢â€¢ ls it a political necessity in order to get the \r\nmoney out of the state or the district? \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Have they given up tarring and feathering? [Laughter] If \r\nthey have, I\'m going to make a statement. If they haven\'t, I\'m \r\ngoing to be quiet. \r\n\r\nGLASS: We\'re not doing any today, so you\'re safe. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Well, all of these terms, to many of the teachers, \r\nmyself included, are like waving a flag in front of the bull, \r\nand you\'re going to end up with some type of charge. Merit pay \r\nI don\'t like; most methods of putting people on career ladders \r\nare subjective in the assessment, and I don\'t per se object to a \r\ncareer ladder, but I do object a great deal to the procedures \r\nand the assessment instruments, because I haven\'t seen one yet \r\nthat isÂ·...... objective. \r\n\r\nNow the only way to have equality in pay is to give everyone \r\nthe same thing, and yet I don\'t think that\'s an answer, because \r\nno matter how good a teacher is--and let\'s be fair, most \r\nteachers are trying to be good, and I think most teachers are \r\ngood or working very hard to become better--the flat truth is, \r\nthey are not the same. Some are better craftsmen, because they \r\nhave a degree of art or talent that produces better results. So \r\nI don\'t think to give everyone the same pay for the same thing \r\nis the answer, either. I\'m doing something I object to other \r\npeople doing: If you criticize, you should have something to \r\noffer in its place, and I really feel that very validly. So if \r\nthese are my only three choices--and I don\'t like any of \r\nthem--it would be a type of career ladder or steps that would \r\ninvolve an assessment, being fully aware that there is the \r\nsubjective danger in assessment. I can\'t buy equal pay for \r\neveryone. There should be, in some manner, a reward for \r\nexcellence. I don\'t think that merit pay is the answer, because \r\nthere\'s too much favoritism, or misuse if you like. \r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that teachers are really making an \r\neffort to be good teachers, this should not be a threatening \r\nthing, but used as an awareness that if you get to this level, \r\nyou have attained a certain degree of excellence. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: Do you have one of these things in operation in \r\nToledo? \r\n\r\n\r\n4\' ~~~ \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question \'5: Pay schemes/2 \r\n\r\nHESS: Well, we are basically opposed to merit pay. We do have a \r\ncommittee that is doing very extensive work and research on a \r\ncareer ladder plan, and what they will look at is a voluntary \r\ntype of situation, and there would be certain criteria involved, \r\nand duties. Could I say something as long as your tape is off? \r\n\r\nVOICES: It\'s not. Never mind, it\'s off the record but on the \r\n\r\ntape. [Laughter] \r\n\r\nHESS: Well, anyway.â€¢â€¢â€¢This is a good example of the kind.of \r\n\r\nissue that is very controversial, so what you are dealing with \r\n\r\nand how you are dealing with it, you are very careful. I would \r\n\r\nnot he able to say certain things about what the committee is \r\n\r\nputting together, because it is not time yet â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ the membership \r\n\r\nhas to be at a certain place before that can transpire. So it \r\n\r\nreally is in the committee process at this point. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: There are just so many loopholes and problems. \r\nWe\'re afraid of it; we are frightened. We can see all the \r\npitfalls, so we back off. Especially teachers--because of \r\ncompetition, cheating, it brings about thing we really don\'t \r\nwant to get involved in, unless it\'s well done, well structured. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: To follow up quickly before we go on to the next \r\nquestion â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ In the shortage areas, it is happening in districts \r\nwhere this is a shortage of, say, science teachers, and they are \r\nwilling to pay them more, bring them in at a higher scale. How \r\ndo you handle that? How do you tell a Latin teacher they\'re \r\ngoing to bring a math teacher in at a higher scale. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Carefully. [Laughter] \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: We proposed that in one of our sessions dealing \r\nwith the Newark school system, and it was totally rejected, \r\nbecause teachers won\'t appreciate that. But, if there is a \r\nshortage of math teachers, what was proposed was that the \r\nteacher who does have the math certification will work with \r\n\r\nlarger numbers [of students] but paraprofessionals will be hired \r\nto help this person and the person will get more money for the \r\nsupervisory task of monitoring the paraprofessional. That \r\nwasn\'t opposed. \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nGORMAN: But you do get to a point, though--and this happens in \r\nNew York City--where you get this huge shortage of math and \r\nscience teachers, to the point where even if you put 40 kids or \r\n45 kids in, you still don\'t have enough teachers, \'and then you \r\nface the problem of bringing in out-of-license teachers. If you \r\nare a superintendent, you\'ve got this problem--you have x number \r\nof vacancies for math and science teachers, and what are you \r\ngoing to do? How is the union going to respond? \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: Okay, math a science may not be a shortage field \r\nforever. I disagree with putting them at a different level, \r\nbecause once you put them in, they progress from there. If you \r\nhave to go to that, then giving them an extra supplement as long \r\n\r\n\r\nff \r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question\'S: Pay schemes/3 \r\n\r\nas it\'s a shortage area â€¢â€¢â€¢ I teach exceptional education. Some \r\n\r\nareas of exceptional education were a shortage area, but are no \r\n\r\nlonger. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: Is it that simple? If they\'re one of your memb~s, how \r\n\r\nare you going to go to them and say, \"Well, now you\'re going to \r\n\r\nlose it [the supplement], it\'s not a shortage area anymore\"? \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: If they go in with the understanding that we\'re just \r\ndoing this to build up the ranks of this critical shortage area, \r\nand when we have done this, this will be removed. If you do it \r\nany other way â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ \r\n\r\nHESS: I was going to say, we had the same thing, and we took it \r\na different way and expanded it in a different way. We, too, \r\nhad at one time a shortage in special education, so they did \r\nreceive an additional increment. Then we took the idea and \r\nexpanded it to go along with specialization. To encourage \r\nteachers, [we said that] you don\'t go out and get your master\'s \r\ndegree in administration and supervision; if you want to remain \r\nin the classroom, then you should be specializing in math or \r\nreading or special ed. So we broadened it so that, say, if I \r\ndid specialization or graduate work in reading, I, too, received \r\nthe increment, so that it flattened it out. It was never taken \r\naway. \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: Or instead of paying the supplement while you\'re \r\n\r\nteaching it, paying the supplement for the people to get the \r\n\r\nadditional education that\'s needed. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: We have that plan in place: shortage areas get a \r\nstipend, until this year, with the oil price drop, some of them \r\nhave been cut, but some are still in place. There is resentment \r\nof it. There is no resentment if they go back for \r\nspecialization, because they have made a special effort and \r\n[that] is thoroughly deserving. The shortage area does exist \r\nand principals do have a problem, but the way the union would \r\nlook at that is simply this way: the union is there for the \r\ninterests of their teachers, and that is an administration \r\nproblem. If they want to attract more teachers, then find some \r\nmanner in their budget to focus on the purpose of \r\neducation--student learning--and provide the necessary money \r\nthat will attract the teachers. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: But do you think that\'s realistic, to have the \r\nadministration handle the problem, that it\'s \"not our problem?\" \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Now I didn\'t say it wasn\'t our problem â€¢â€¢â€¢.Well, yes \r\ndid. My viewpoint, though â€¢â€¢â€¢we should be involved in it, but if \r\nit comes to a choice, our responsibility is to our member. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: But if the alternative is to hire a teacher out of \r\nlicense or lower the standards â€¢â€¢â€¢. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Don\'t hire them. \r\n\r\n\r\n(I-\r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question\'S: Pay schemes/4 \r\n\r\nGORMAN: What do you do with the 35 students that don\'t have a \r\n\r\nmath teacher? \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: In New Jersey, we have a program in place called an \r\nalternate route teacher, and this is a person who has a degree. \r\nLet\'s say you have a degree in chemistry, but you\'re not a \r\nteacher. So you come into the system as a chemistry teacher, \r\nclosely monitored--almost as an internship--with a neighboring \r\nteacher and enrolled in a college for teacher credits, until you \r\nget your teacher certification. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: It\'s driving the higher education people crazy â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: Oh â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ yes. \r\n\r\nHESS: When we did have that special ed. shortage and that \r\n\r\nincrement, our other people did resent it [but] that was \r\n\r\nultimately our creative way of dealing with it. It turned out \r\n\r\nactually to be a good thing, because it led us into the \r\n\r\nspecialization thing. \r\n\r\nGORMAN: So, in other words, how you handled it was you did \r\n\r\nprovide additional money for the shortage area, but you sort of \r\n\r\nparlayed that into a larger career ladder program. \r\n\r\nHESS: Yes. \r\n\r\nROGER GLASS: I want to ask about peer evaluation. Can you \r\n\r\nbriefly tell us how you stand or how your colleagues stand on \r\nthis: Do they support the idea? \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: If we could use the word mentor--any time you get into \r\npeople evaluating--I know what you\'re saying. I\'m not the best \r\nteacher that I could be. I like to think that I\'m pretty good, \r\nbut I know I\'ve got things to learn. I think if we can think \r\nabout peers as the wealth of experience that we can learn from \r\nand get away from evaluation â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ but on the other hand, the \r\npresent system is not working; there\'s too much evaluation being \r\ndone by principals who\'ve been out of the classroom for 15 or 20 \r\nyears. \r\n\r\nWOODS: I like the idea of peer evaluation, quite frankly, \r\nbecause I had it earlier on when I started teaching. There was \r\na department chairman who didn\'t know that she wasn\'t supposed \r\nto do that [laughter], and so she came in and observed me and \r\ndid an evaluation that was far more helpful than what I got from \r\nthe principal, who came in and observed me while I was \r\nadministering a test and said I had great rapport with students \r\n\r\n[laughter]. I would favor the Toledo plan [internships \r\nsupervised by consulting teachers] for the first year; second, \r\nit would be helpful if people in the building served as peer \r\ncoaches and give some feedback. That would not have to be a \r\nformal process; as a matter of fact, I think it\'s wisest if it\'s \r\nnot. I would like it if somebody from the district at large \r\ncame in and evaluated me so that I had something concrete that \r\n\r\n\r\n.. \r\n\r\n(I \r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question-S: Pay schemes/S \r\n\r\nwould help me improve as an English teacher--emphasis on both of \r\nthose things. I know I have good rapport with the students. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: I\'m resentful of being judged â€¢â€¢â€¢ by anybody. In the last \r\nfew years, I\'ve had three different types of assessment \r\ninstruments to be measured by. I have 30 students each class, \r\nfive times a day--they judge me. I have approximately 60 \r\nparents for each of those 30 that judge me; my graduates go out \r\ninto the public, and I am judged. I even now at this time--I\'ve \r\nbeen around so long--grandchildren that have come back. I think \r\nteachers are judged enough. \r\n\r\nNow, all through your comments, Deanna, you have mentioned \r\npeers as a resource. I think peers are an excellent resource, \r\nan excellent aid to improve, but not to write or create any type \r\nof judgment. We have mentioned the plan presented to us the \r\nfirst evening we were here--the self-evaluation. I would prefer \r\nto change that word to self-help. I\'m sick to death of the \r\nwords judge and evaluate, and that may be an emotional response. \r\n\r\nWOODS: I would not use the word judge at all. I like the idea \r\nof two evaluation systems--and I use evaluation as a \r\nconstructive approach--I think there ought to be a Toled~ level, \r\nwhere you\'re dealing with the first-year teacher and helping \r\nthat person grow, as well as screening out people who really \r\nshould not continue. The second mode is evaluation of the \r\ntenured teacher, whose major purpose is for professional \r\ngrowth. Period. We\'re not talking about conditions of \r\ndismissal--for that you have the intervention program. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Well, power corrupts. Anyone who evaluates and judges \r\n\r\ntends to think they\'re a power element. Using your terms, I \r\n\r\ntotally agree with you. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: There\'s some problems in education. We\'ve found \r\nthat out. Now, there are some incompetent teachers out there, \r\nand we have to do something. We can\'t hard-line some issues and \r\nsoft-pedal other issues. We have to decide that â€¢.â€¢. there\'s a \r\nlovely lady down the hall who\'s been teaching for 20 years, and \r\nsome way she\'s squeezed through the cracks all these yeas, but \r\nshe\'s really not doing the job. Now what are we going to do \r\nabout it? Someone is either going to evaluate her â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢we have to \r\nscreen her out, we have to do something. We cannot say let\'s \r\nchange education and come through with all these reforms but \r\nlet\'s leave these terrible teachers in. We have to do something \r\nabout it if we really want some say~so in our profession.\r\n\r\n, \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: As a starter, the ER&D, as peers to help them, if that \r\nfails, then as the Saturn program presented itself for a \r\nscreening-out to where you help them in some manner become aware \r\nthat they need to leave. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: Okay, Basil, you know what it sounds like? It\'s \r\n\r\nlike the mother at home with the children and they\'ve done \r\n\r\nterrible things all day long, and she says, \"Wait until your \r\n\r\nfather gets home.\" What you\'re saying is that we\'ll give peer \r\n\r\n\r\n\' .. \r\n\r\n,1t\r\n\r\nA1r\'1\"1e 1nterv1ew\'/Quest10n~~: Pay schemes/ 6 \r\n\r\nassistance, we\'ll talk about it, we\'ll do all these things, but \r\n\r\nif you don\'t measure up, who\'s going to get rid of her? The \r\n\r\nprincipal? Then you pass the buck to the administration. \r\n\r\nSuppose they really have to go? \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Let me ask you one question. \"They have to go\" is our \r\npremise. Now, let\'s come back to, as a union member, let\'s come \r\nback to two words: Have they been offered due process under \r\ntheir hiring system? Did that due process include some \r\nassistance for correction? If the answer is yes, then as hard \r\nas that may be, then life is hard--we\'re sinking to platitudes \r\n[laughter]--and\'we\'re sorry they have to go, but go they must. \r\nOur prime purpose for being in school is for the students to \r\nlearn, and they are defeating the purpose of the school. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: But now, who does it? The peer review panel that \r\n\r\nhas done all of these things here, orâ€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: The system that is in place. If it is in my school, in \r\nthis case, it would have to be the principal. If it is in \r\nanother school, with assistance, it would have to be the \r\ncommittee. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: Does the Toledo plan terminate? \r\n\r\nHESS: Yes â€¢â€¢â€¢ for the intern teacher. It is dealt with by the \r\nintern panel. For the intervention, which is the experienced \r\nteacher\"the consulting teacher works with that teacher and \r\nmakes a report. There is not the same kind of time limit. It \r\nthen reverts to the personnel department to do what they \r\nwant â€¢â€¢â€¢what the program shows us that, unfortunately, there are \r\nsome people who do not belong in teaching, even if they want to \r\nteach. \r\n\r\nWOODS: If we do our job as educators of ensuring that teacher \r\npreparation is what it should be, that the internships are in \r\nplace, that the screening process does its job, then we\'re going \r\nto be able to concentrate and look at tenured teacher evaluation \r\nas a professional growth thing. \r\n\r\n\r\n.\' \r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question 6: The Union/l \r\n\r\nGORMAN: I have one final question, which has two parts. You\'ve \r\n\r\nspent a week here being bombarded with this big dose of \r\n\r\neducation reform. Now you\'ve got to go back and figure out what \r\n\r\nto do with it. What have you learned here, first of all â€¢â€¢.â€¢ one \r\n\r\nthing that would be your message? The next question has to do \r\n\r\nwith the union. The AFT has been pretty receptive to \r\n\r\nreform--some have argued that it has been too accommodating--and \r\n\r\nthat we need to stick to traditional union issue. My question \r\n\r\nis, is the union going in the right direction? \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: By moving more into professional issues? \r\n\r\nGORMAN: Yes, implementing education reform â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ it is not without \r\nits pain, in terms of bring\'~Jpeople along.\r\n\r\n/\'. \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: Yes. The biggest complaint as building rep that I get \r\nby people who don\'t want to join the union is that we here to \r\nprotect Joe Schmuck down the hallway who knows the contract \r\nbackwards and forwards and uses the union to protect his \r\n\r\nincompetence â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ I\'m s,orry that that happens, but that\'s the side ~ \r\nof the union they see. What do we have to counter that with? \r\nTo prove to you that that is not what the union is or stands \r\n\r\nfor, here we have the ER&D and the Carnegie planning board and \r\nall the other things that the union is doing. I think what \r\nwe\'re talking about is the survival of the union, and I\'m \r\nnot--you guys won\'t like this--but I\'m really not a deep-down \r\nunion person â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ just because my focus is elsewhere or I don\'t \r\nhave the background. I am a professional issues person. That\'s \r\nwhere my total focus is, and that\'s where you\'re going to get \r\nyour other [members]. \r\n\r\nThe other thing â€¢â€¢â€¢you asked what we learned â€¢â€¢â€¢ I think the \r\nunion has to allow us â€¢â€¢â€¢ if we want to make this a profession \r\nthen we have to be accountable. That was our issue that we \r\ntalked about until 9:30 last night--accountability. I came away \r\nfrom that â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ there\'s a fear on the part of teachers about \r\naccountability, but accountability can be our greatest friend. \r\nIf we can demonstrate to the public that we are accountable, \r\njust like a business has to demonstrate that they are showing \r\nfiscal responsibility, that\'s where we\'re going to gain public \r\nsupport. Public support means money. They\'re not going to \r\nthrow good money after bad. So how do we demonstrate \r\naccountability in education? Well, we do all the things we\'ve \r\nbeen talking about today. We make sure the teachers coming in \r\nare competent, that we increape the standards for teacher \r\ncollege education. You know, medical school is not an easy \r\nthing to get through. The result is a doctor, who is \r\nresponsible for people\'s lives. Teachers college should not be \r\nan easy thing to get through. We are responsible for children\'s \r\nlives. That should not be an easy degree to get nor should it \r\nbe something that we\'re not paid well for doing. Yes, I think \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢\\ \r\nAirlie interview/Question 6: The Union/2 \r\n\r\nwe should test our new teachers, to demonstrate that the people \r\n\r\ncoming in are competent and know their field. Yes, we want to \r\n\r\nhave continued growth. If we can demonstrate that we have all \r\n\r\nthese things in place, then we\'re demonstrating to the public \r\n\r\nthat we\'re taking responsibility for being accountable. I feel \r\n\r\nvery strong that teaching right now is not a profession. We\'ve \r\n\r\ngot to do those things. \r\n\r\nWOODS: I agree with almost all of what you said. The only \r\n\r\nthing â€¢â€¢â€¢ I\'m more a union member than you may be. \r\n\r\nOSBORNE: Then you\'ve probably had a different history. \r\n\r\nWOODS: Yes. I think that\'s the thing. I agree that we have to \r\n\r\nbe changing and that we\'re going in the right direction. We\'re \r\n\r\nnot a very old union â€¢â€¢. how many years are we, when were we born, \r\n\r\n1918, 19l7? \r\n\r\nGORMAN: 1916. \r\n\r\nWOODS: 1916. So we\'re only about 70 years old. We\'re in the \r\n\r\nprocess of growth and as union leaders and members, we have a \r\n\r\nresponsibility to nurture this child, this union, towards \r\n\r\nadulthood, okay. The point is, it\'s not going to be any easier \r\n\r\nthan the process of the growth of a human being, and we have to \r\n\r\nrecognize that fact and be willing to go through all that we \r\n\r\nhave to go through in order to make it what it is. We HAVE to \r\ngrow, we have to develop, we have to undergo these kinds of \r\nchanges, because we have to meet the needs of our members. Our \r\nmembers are not isolated beings, they\'re members of society, \r\nthey\'re teaching the children of this society, and we\'re all \r\nbuilding society. consequently, we have to go in the direction \r\nwe\'re going. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: I would agree a great deal with you. In what I have \r\n\r\nlearned here is that across the nation, there is a uniformity of \r\nneed to focus on the school and [to ask] is the school meeting \r\nthe needs of the students, and these needs are changing, to \r\n\r\nfocus on having these students achieve and succeed in a real \r\nworld environment, which is changing and totally different from \r\nthe one in which we grew up and were educated in? I grew \r\nup â€¢â€¢â€¢when I went to sleep at night, I would wake up in the \r\nmorning with the same world. When they split the atom, that \r\nconcept was forever destroyed, and students go to bed at night, \r\nand in just that short a time.-seven hours--will wake up and the \r\nworld is totally different â€¢..â€¢ \r\n\r\nI agree with you [motioning to Deanna Woods]--the union is a \r\nliving thing and therefore involves beliefs and changes of \r\nbeliefs, and we\'ll grow. But were we when we first started? We \r\nwere interested in teacher salary and in working, environmental \r\nconditions of the day\'s instruction. But as we have gone on, \r\nthe school is more. Those kids, when we were focused on salary \r\nand environment, were different from the students that we have \r\ntoday. And the teachers have changed. We have become more \r\nmature, more experienced, and rather than just getting a college \r\n\r\n\r\nAirlie interview/Question 6: The Union/3 \r\n\r\ndegree, I think we have become educated and are continuing to \r\neducate ourselves right now. I think our role as the union in \r\nthe future is a self-determination of what the profession is and \r\nwhat our goals shall be. \r\n\r\nHUTCHERSON: From the beginning of the conference until now, I \r\nhave heard over and over again, \"teachers take charge of your \r\nprofession.\" And really, that is what I agree with, that is \r\nwhat I\'ve come to hear and that\'s what I\'m leaving with. Yes, \r\nwe are moving in the right direction, and hopefully, we will \r\ntake charge of things that will govern our profession and make \r\nus a profession. \r\n\r\nHESS: In my case, I already had the very deep commitment to \r\nteachers taking charge of their profession and I think that \r\ncommitment has been deepened and makes me feel that we are on \r\nthe right track. As far as the unÂ£on goes â€¢â€¢â€¢when I started out \r\n26 years ago, I considered myself a professional, and I went \r\nwith the association [NEA] because I was really brainwashed that \r\nthat\'s where professionalism was. After 10 years, I learned \r\nthat that was not the case, and I went through a real conversion~ \r\nprocess, and really saw the union was really doing what needed \r\nto be done to make a profession. That is still continuing. One \r\nof our teachers said to me before I came that the union needs to \r\nbe the conscience of education. reform, that\'s our role. I really \r\nbelieve that. \r\n\r\nTHOMAS: Saul has become St. Paul.

HadÂ· dmilar changes taken .place ~n ~ny othc;!r \"industry,\" \r\nit would have been ;\'ront page news. Why not in education? Because \r\nmost news coverage of schools is done by education reporters and editors \r\nwho emphasize the educational aspects of change ... as. they should.Â· \r\nBut it\'s about timeÂ·Â·labor reporters and editors got into the act because a \r\nlarge. number of the exciting ~haDges in labor relations today are hap.\r\npening in schools. \r\nFew people realize fnat public school employees are the most unioniZfd \r\npart of the Amerkar.. workforce. About 85-90 percent of the nation\'s \r\n2.4 million teachers are unionized. Even so, ther\'e are II number of \r\nstates, especjally in the South, where teacher unions are relatively weak \r\nand where they are still denied collective-bargaining rights. \r\nThe.last five yearsÂ· have been\' times of change and reform for our \r\nschools. Ifyou accept the widespread negative view of unions, you would \r\nexpect the greatest changes to have taken pla~e in those districts where \r\nunions are non-existent or weakest. Many would proclaim that little or \r\nno change could take 1Pla.ce where unions are pig and powerful-at least \r\nnot without a bloody battle. Indeed, U.S. Education~Secretary Williain \r\nBennett constantly playt;d on this stereotype of unions when he kept \r\nwar~ing that teacher ~Jlnions were standing in the way of reform. . -\r\nBut what has actually happened? Whai\'Sbeen missed by the la60r \r\npress? That the most fundamental education and labor-management reforms \r\nare .taking place in strong unionized school districts.

The \r\nmoral is that teachers wifh ~ strong union are willing to takt: chances and, \r\nmake changes that teachers without union protection will understandably \r\nresist. f \r\nOf course, this has not happened everywhere. Why it\'s happening \r\nbecomes clear when you take a close look at what these teacher union \r\nleaders are doing at the ).:)cal level.

McElRO\' \r\nSECRETARY-TREASURER\r\n\r\n.,FEDERATION OF \r\n\r\nT~~l}t~ \r\n\r\nDear AFT Member: \r\n\r\nIn 1985, AFT President AI Shanker called for a voluntary national certification \r\nsystem to recognize outstanding classroom teachers. At that time, there was no broad \r\nconsensus ofstandards for excellence in teaching against which experienced teachers \r\ncould assess their knowledge and skills and be recognized as accomplished professionals. \r\nBut that changed with the establishment ofthe National Board for Professional Teaching \r\nStandards --an organization on whose board AI sat as a founding member and on which I \r\ncurrently serve. \r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that National Board Certification is a completely \r\nvoluntary assessment ofteaching that involves a rigorous examination ofa teacher\'s actual \r\npractice in the classroom. And, most significantly, it is an assessment system developed for \r\nand by teachers. Teachers hold the majority ofseats on the NBPTS board ofdirectors and \r\non the committees that write standards for what accomplished teachers should know and \r\nbe able to do. Teachers review and comment on the standards before they are adopted and \r\nthey field test the assessment exercises. And, teachers administer and score the \r\ncertification exercises. \r\n\r\nThe National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is unique --it strengthens \r\nthe teaching profession as a whole, while it benefits individual teachers. Indeed, many of \r\nour locals have negotiated additional pay, continuing education credit, or \"lead teacher\" \r\nstatus for National Board Certified teachers. Such incentives vary from district to district \r\nand state to state. But, even where such rewards are not available, and even ifteachers try \r\nand do not gain certification, they all report that the National Board certification process is \r\nan extraordinary learning experience. Teachers tell us that the NBPTS assessment process \r\nmade a profound impact on them, causing them to analyze, reassess, and sometimes \r\nmodify their teaching and the way they work with students. \r\n\r\nIfyou are not already familiar with National Board Certification, this booklet will \r\nanswer some ofyour questions and tell you how to find more information. I urge you to \r\ntake this opportunity to learn more about National Board Certification and make it the \r\ncenterpiece in your plans for professional growth. \r\n\r\nIn solidarity, \r\n\r\n~d~ \r\n\r\nPresident \r\n\r\n3 \r\n\r\n\r\nAmerironFederationifTral:x;rs \r\n\r\n\r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\nNationalBarrdforPrrforionalTearhingStandmrls \r\n\r\nWhat Is National Board \r\nCertification? \r\n\r\nN\r\nN\r\national Board Certification is a significant step in professionalizing \r\nteaching, a credential that says a teacher\'s knowledge, skills, \r\n\r\nand accomplishments have been recognized by his or her peers. \r\n\r\nDeveloped by and for classroom teachers, National Board Certification \r\n\r\nallows the profession to set high and rigorous standards for itself, create \r\n\r\nmeaningful performance assessments based on those standards, and iden\r\n\r\n\r\ntify experienced teachers who meet the standards. . \r\n\r\nUnlike state licensing systems, which set entry-level standards for \r\n\r\nbeginning teachers, National Board Certification establishes advanced \r\n\r\nstandards for experienced teachers. Where state licensing focuses on \r\n\r\ncourse requirements and varies from state to state, National Board \r\n\r\nCertification focuses on knowledge, performance, and professional judg\r\n\r\n\r\nment, reflecting nationally recognized standards that were set by teachers. \r\n\r\nAnd National Board Certification-unlike state licensing-is completely \r\n\r\nvoluntary. \r\n\r\nThe year-long certification process provides outstanding opportuni\r\n\r\n\r\nties for collaboration and reflection as teachers refine and strengthen their \r\n\r\nskills on the basis of standards written and reviewed by their peers. \r\n\r\nTeachers demonstrate their progress in meeting the standards through an \r\n\r\ninnovative two-part performance assessment that goes far beyond the \r\n\r\nusual checklist evaluation or short-answer test: \r\n\r\nSchool-site portfolio. At their own schools, teachers compile a \r\n\r\nportfolio that includes four or five classroom-based exercises-such as \r\n\r\nvideotaped lessons and samples of student work, together with written \r\n\r\nanalysis-plus documentation of their accomplishments outside the \r\n\r\nclassroom with colleagues, parents, and the community. \r\n\r\nAssessment center exercise. At assessment centers located \r\n\r\naround the country, teachers complete four 90-minute written tasks and \r\n\r\nexercises, such as simulated situations or discussions of instructional \r\n\r\nissues. \r\n\r\nThis certification system is operated by the National Board for \r\nProfessional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), an independent, nonprofit \r\n. organization led by a 63-member board of directors, the majority of \r\n\r\n5 \r\n\r\n\r\nAmerimnFedemtion ojTeorlxrs \r\n\r\n\r\nwhom are classroom teachers. Teachers have also played the leading role \r\nin developing standards in more than 30 certificate fields, which are \r\ndefined by student developmental level and subject areas (see the framework \r\non page 7 and 8 for a list of the certificate areas). In addition, the \r\nportfolio and assessment center exercises are scored by teachers who have \r\nbeen specially trained in performance assessment. \r\n\r\nTo date, 912 teachers have received National Board Certification. \r\nMany of them took advantage of local and state fee supports and incentives \r\nin deciding to stand for certification, and many successful candidates \r\nhave received financial bonuses, as well. But regardless of incentives or \r\nrewards, these teachers say they value the opportunity for intense analysis \r\noftheir teaching and the deep sense ofpersonal and professional achievement \r\nthey gain through the National Board Certification process. \r\n\r\n6 \r\n\r\n\r\nNationalBrxmlforPrrfosionalTeathingStundtm:Is \r\n\r\nFramework ofNational Board \r\nCertificates \r\n\r\n/Early Cltildltood IAges 3-8J \r\n\r\nGeneralist* \r\n\r\nMiddle Cltildltood IAges 7-\'2J \r\n\r\nGeneralist* \r\nEnglish Language Arts \r\nMathematics \r\nScience \r\nSocial Studies-History \r\n\r\n/Early and Middle Cltildltood IAges 3-\'2J \r\n\r\nArt \r\nEnglish as a New Language \r\nExceptional Needs/Generalist \r\nForeign Language \r\nGuidance Counseling \r\nLibrarylMedia \r\nMusic \r\nPhysical Education \r\n\r\n/Early Adolescence IAges \"-,5J \r\n\r\nGeneralist* \r\nEnglish Language Arts* \r\nMathematics \r\nScience \r\nSocial Studies-History \r\n\r\nAdolescence and Young Adul\"\'ood IAges \'4-\'8+J \r\n\r\nEnglish Language Arts \r\nMathematics* \r\nScience** \r\nSocial Studies-History \r\n\r\n\r\n7 \r\n\r\nAmeriranFedemtionifTeadxJJ \r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Adolescence tltroug\" Young Adultltood \r\n\r\n(Ages 11.18+1 \r\n\r\nAIt* \r\n\r\nEnglish as a New Language \r\nExceptional Needs/Generalist \r\nForeign Language \r\nGuidance Counseling \r\nHealth \r\nLibrarylMedia \r\nMusic \r\nPhysical Education \r\nVocational Education \r\n\r\n*Certificates are being offered in these six areas during the 1997-98 school year. \r\n\r\n**This certificate is under development and may also be offered in the 1997-98 \r\n\r\nschoolyear. \r\n\r\nWho Is Eligible for National Board \r\nCertification? \r\n\r\nMost experienced teachers in public or private schools are eligible. \r\nThe process is open to you ifyou: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nhave completed a baccalaureate degree; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nhave taught for a minimum of three years at the early childhood, \r\nmentary, middle school, or secondary school level; and \r\nâ€¢ \r\nhave held a valid state teaching license for each of those years. \r\na license is not required, you must teach in a school that is recoe:nl.ze( \r\nand approved by the state.) \r\n\r\n8 \r\n\r\n\r\nNational&rmiforProjssionalTeadingStandarris \r\n\r\nHow Does National Board \r\nCertification Work? \r\n\r\n\r\nNational Board Certification has three components: the standards, the \r\nportfolio, and the assessment center. \r\n\r\nI. \'lite standards. If you decide to pursue National Board \r\nCertification, your first step is to study the standards in your chosen certifIcate \r\narea so that you will understand how they might be reflected in \r\nyour classroom teaching. All NBPTS standards are based on five \"core \r\npropositions\" that define the \"knowledge, skills, dispositions, and commitments\" \r\nthat distinguish accomplished teachers: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nTeachers are committed to students and their learning. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nTeachers know the subjects they teach and how to teach those subjects \r\nto students. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nTeachers are responsible for managing and monitoring student learnmg. \r\nâ€¢ Teachers think systematically about their practice and learn from expe, \r\nrience. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nTeachers are members oflearning communities. \r\n(From the NBPTS policy statement \r\nWhat Teachers Should Know and Be Able To Do) \r\n\r\nSpecific standards for each subject area and student age group are \r\n\r\nby committees made up ofteachers and subject area specialists, \r\n\r\nthey are reviewed extensively by teachers and other educators before \r\n\r\nadopted. In each certifIcate field, the standards are presented in a \r\n\r\nformat: \r\n\r\n9 \r\n\r\n\r\nAmericanFedemtionrfTeatkrs \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ A summary statement, which describes specific aspects of a teacher\'s \r\npractice that have an impact on students. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nAn elaboration, which puts the summary statement in context and \r\nexplains the knowledge and skills the teacher needs in order to meet \r\nthe standard. \r\nFor example, in the Middle Childhood/Generalist Standards, one \r\nsummary standard reads: \"Accomplished teachers draw on their knowledge \r\nof subject matter and curriculum to make sound decisions about \r\nwhat is important for students to learn within and across the subject areas \r\nthat comprise the middle school curriculum.\" The elaboration of that \r\nstandard describes the curricular knowledge and pedagogical skills \r\nexpected of an accomplished teacher in this area, using examples of \r\nactions and attitudes that meet the standard. \r\n\r\nNational Board standards do not set out anyone best approach to \r\nteaching, however. While they reflect broad professional consensus on \r\nwhat accomplished teachers should know and be able to do, they \r\nacknowledge the complexity and uniqueness of teaching and recognize . \r\nthat teachers need to be able to call on a wide range ofteaching strategies \r\nand methods in order to respond appropriately to all students. \r\n\r\nYou can order copies of the standards from NBPTS. Call 1-800-22TEACH \r\nor visit the NBPTS web site, www.nbpts.org. \r\n\r\n2. \"\'e portfolio. This is your chance to choose evidence \r\nyour teaching that shows your understanding of the standards, \r\n10 \r\n\r\n\r\nNationalBrxmiforPrrforionolTeorJingStandmrJs \r\n\r\nknowledge of your students and your subject area, your ability to make \r\nsound professional judgments about student learning, and your skill in \r\nacting effectively on those judgments . \r\n\r\nPortfolios vary for each certificate, but the exercises typically require \r\nevidence of a particular teaching episode and your written reflections \r\nabout it. For example, one exercise from the Early Childhood/Generalist \r\nportfolio focuses on a \"teaching and learning sequence\" that shows how \r\nyou \"nurture children\'s growth and learning\" as you explore a theme \r\ndrawn from the social studies and the arts. The exercise asks you to submit \r\nup to ten pages of written commentary and four supporting work \r\nsamples to illustrate a two-to four-week teaching and learning sequence \r\nyou have used in your classroom. The sequence must be unified by some \r\ncore theme or topic; it must integrate social studies with the arts; and it \r\nmust illustrate your efforts to build strong ties with children\'s families. \r\n\r\nTwo ofthe work samples or materials you submit must relate to students\' \r\nÂ·learning, and two must relate to your evaluation of the success of the \r\nsequence. \r\nSome portfolio exercises call for videotapes of actual lessons in your \r\nf:lassroom. Teachers often find these videotapes challenging. Here\'s how \r\nteacher described the experience: \r\n\r\n\"Videotaping myself was sheer agony .... My classroom practices were based \r\non sound theory-or were they? I didn\'t know and had no gauge to measure what \r\nI had been doing. The standards to measure my teaching performance were in front \r\nofme, but I didn\'t know how to produce the evidence that I had reached those standards. \r\nI had never been asked to analyze my own teaching practices ....\" \r\n\r\n-Ann Sayas, \"To Grow a Teacher,\" \r\nTeacher to Teacher, Spring 1996) \r\n\r\nBut for this teacher and others, the videotape provoked self-analysis \r\nled to professional growth. \"I had to look deep inside myself as a proand \r\nunderstand my own strengths as well as weaknesses,\" said \r\nteacher about the experience. But working with a colleague who \r\nand critiqued practice tapes helped this teacher gain new perspecon \r\nher lessons and her interactions with students. \"I have learned \r\nabout myself as a professional during these past months than I have \r\n\r\npast eight and a half years that I have taught,\" she said. \r\n\r\nteachers say they spend about 120 hours compiling their portfoaverage \r\nof about one day a week over a semester. And most agree \r\ntime is well spent-in fact, many say it is one of the most valu\r\n\r\n\r\n11 \r\n\r\n\r\nAmeritanFedemtionrfTeod:m \r\n\r\n\r\nable professional development experiences of their lives. \r\nA portfolio sampler, which includes sample portfolio exercises from \r\nsix certificate fields, is available from NBPTS. \r\n\r\n\"On my own, without the extrinsic incentive of the portfolio process, I never \r\nwould have been able to be so introspective and reflective about my teaching. I \r\nwouldn\'t have gone as deep. We use a lot ofportfolio assessment at my school. Now, \r\nI don\'t mind asking my students to do what I\'ve done-\'-to work hard and think \r\nabout what they are doing and why.\" \r\n\r\n-Susan Coley \r\nCleveland Middle School \r\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico \r\n\r\n3. \'lite assessment center. The final step in the National \r\nBoard Certification process is the assessment center, where you will spend \r\na full day completing additional exercises away from your school. \r\nExercises are offered for several weeks each summer, and you can reserve \r\na date, time, and place convenient for you. There are more than 200 \r\nassessment centers; at least one in every state. \r\nAt the assessment center, you might be asked to plan a lesson around \r\nmaterials you were sent in advance, or to write a brief essay about an issue \r\nin pedagogy, or to analyze a videotape of another teacher at work, or to \r\ntake part in an interview. Where the portfolio gives you a chance to \r\ndemonstrate your teaching, these exercises complement the portfolio by \r\ncalling on the knowledge, skills, and judgment that undergird your portfolio \r\nperformance. \r\n\r\nBoth the portfolio entries and the assessment center exercises are \r\nscored by classroom teachersÂ· in your field who have received intensive \r\ntraining in performance assessment. Scoring is based on all of the evidence \r\nyou have submitted-videotapes, written commentary, students\' \r\nwork samples, and responses to the assessment center exercises. Each \r\nentry is scored independendy by several assessors, using agreed-upon \r\nscoring criteria. \r\n\r\n4. Results. You\'ll learn how you did in mid-to late fall, after the \r\nassessors have scored your portfolio and assessment center exercises: \r\nAlong with the results, you\'ll be sent a feedback report, which includes an \r\noverview of the scoring guides, an explanation of how the scores on the \r\nvarious exercises are weighted, and an actual portfolio entry that received \r\na score of 3, or pass. The feedback report also includes tips on how you \r\ncan extrapolate from this portfolio entry to your own so that you can bet12 \r\n\r\n\r\nNationolBamiforPtrfoirmalTeochingStaruirm:lr \r\n\r\n\r\nter understand the score you received. \r\n\r\nIfyou fmd you\'ve done well on some exercises but not well enough on \r\nothers to earn National Board Certification, a new policy allows you to \r\n\"bank\" scores for up to three years. During that three-year period, you \r\nmay submit new portfolio entries or retake assessment center exercises \r\nand have a new total score calculated. \r\n\r\nHow Do I apply\'for National Board \r\nCertification? \r\n\r\nApplications will be available as ofJune 1, 1998 for the seven certifications \r\nbeing offered during the 1998-99 year: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nEarly Childhood/Generalist (ages 3-8) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nMiddle Childhood/Generalist (ages 7-12) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nEarly Adolescence/Generalist (ages 11-15) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nEarly Adolescence/English Language Arts (ages 11-15) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nEarly Adolescence through Young Adulthood/Art (ages 11-18+) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nAdolescence and Young AdulthoodlMathematics (ages 14-18+) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nAdolescence and Young Adulthood/Science (ages 14-18+) \r\nAn additional five certificates are planned to be available December 1, \r\n1998: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nEarly AdolescencelMathematics (ages 11-15) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nEarly Adolescence/Science (ages 11-15) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nEarly Adolescence/Social Studies-History (ages 11-15) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nAdolescence and Young Adulthood/English Language Arts \r\n(ages 14-18+) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nAdolescence and Young Adulthood/Social Studies-History \r\n(ages 14-18+) \r\nApplications for these twelve certificates must be postmarked by \r\nDecember 1, 1998. Portfolio instructions will be sent to you after your \r\napplication has been received. For the seven certificates available June 1, \r\n1998, completed portfolios must arrive at the National Board by April 16, \r\n1999.

As an AFT member, you can \r\nfund this fee through an AFT-JOIN loan, which allows you to set up \r\naffordable payments and take several years to repay the loan. For more \r\ninformation or to request a loan application, call toll free, Monday \r\nthrough Friday, 1-888-AFT-JOIN. \r\n\r\nIn addition, many local school districts, state legislatures, or depart\r\n\r\n\r\nments of education, and unions either pay the application fee or offer \r\n\r\nincentive grants to help defray the cost. In Minnesota, for example, the \r\n\r\nSt. Paul School District, in collaboration with the St. Paul Federation of \r\n\r\nTeachers, the University of Minnesota, and others, paid the application \r\n\r\nfee and provided professional support programs for 20 teachers in 1995\r\n\r\n\r\n96 and another 20 in 1996-97. In New York, the New York State United \r\n\r\nTeachers is offering to pay $1,500, to be awarded in three steps, to 140 of \r\n\r\nits Effective Teaching Program instructors who stand for National Board \r\n\r\nCertification. And in Ohio, the state legislature appropriated funds to pay \r\n\r\nthe application fees for up to 400 teachers in the 1996-97 school year. \r\n\r\n\"It took lots of time to put together the portfolio, \r\nbut it was very beneficial. I had never \r\ndocumented all the things I had done before.

Under the program, funds \r\nrecommended by President Clinton and appropriatedÂ· by the U.S. \r\nCongress have been made available to help subsidize the $2,000 candidate \r\nfee for teachers pursuing National Board Certification in 1998-99, \r\nand with continued appropriations, very possibly in 1999-2000 and subsequent \r\nyears. Contact your state department of education to determine \r\nwhat fee supports are available. \r\n\r\nTo find out more about fee supports and incentives where you live, ask \r\nyour local or state union leaders or check the \"Where It\'s Happening\" \r\nsection of the NBPTS web page (www.nbpts.org). \r\n\r\nWhy Should I Consider National \r\nBoard Certification? \r\n\r\nDepending on their local contracts, some teachers receive direct monetary \r\nawards, steps up the salary scale, or recognition as lead or master \r\nteachers as a result of National Board Certification, but most who have \r\nbeen through the process cite other compelling benefits as well: \r\n\r\nProfessional development. Unlike the typical one-shot, one-size-fitsall \r\napproach to professional development, the year-long certification \r\nprocess allows teachers to focus intendy on their own strengths and weaknesses, \r\nleading them to reflect on how their practice meets the profession\'s \r\nstandards for accomplished teaching. Whether they attain certification or \r\nnot, almost all candidates find the experience makes them stronger teachers-\r\nand more aware of what works and what doesn\'t in the classroom. \r\n\"The National Board Certification process is definitely one of inquiry,\" \r\nsaid Barbara Winkfield ofSouthfield, Mich. \"I examined and reexamined \r\nevery aspect of my teaching practice. I reflected and drew upon all the \r\nbest practices I\'d learned.\" For most teachers, the experience is a once-ina-\r\nlifetime opportunity. \r\n\r\n15 \r\n\r\n\r\nAmeritanFedemtionojTeoiJ:m \r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was almost ready to quit teaching. I thought I knew what should be done in \r\nthe classroom, but I needed some validation that my instincts were right. National \r\nBoard Certification was a turning point for me-I felt as ifI were corning out of \r\nthe closet. I thought I was at the end\' of my teaching. career, but National Board \r\nCertification was a new beginning. I don\'t know where I\'ll go from here, but I know \r\nthere\'s absolutely no way I can be driven out of the teaching profession now.\" \r\n\r\n-Sandra Richardson \r\nPuesta Del Sol Elementary School \r\nRio Rancho, New Mexico \r\n\r\nCollaboration. Most teachers have litde or no opportunity to share \r\nideas and information with each other; instead they are, in the words of \r\none teacher, trapped in a \"solitary teaching bubble.\" Working in teams to \r\nearn certification, teachers can burst that bubble and gain valuable support \r\nfrom each other and insight into their own performance through \r\ntheir colleagues\' eyes. This collaboration can take many forms. In a North \r\nCarolina school district, for example, candidates for certification gathered \r\nweekly for dinner and discussion at one teacher\'s home. In a Colorado \r\ndistrict, a mentor group of National Board Certified teachers met regularly \r\nwith new candidates to help them work through the process. \r\nThrough collaborative arrangements such as these, teachers can work \r\ntogether to clarify their goals, interpret the standards, provide resources \r\nfor each other, and give each other constructive feedback and moral support. \r\n\r\n\r\nNew roles for teachers. Traditionally, the only way to advance in a \r\nteaching career was to leave the classroom. National Board Certification \r\nis beginning to change that by opening the way for new roles for accomplished \r\nteachers. Already, many school districts and states are conferring \r\n\"master teacher\" or \"lead teacher\" designation on certified teachers, with \r\nthe accompanying salary increments. (See the \"Where It\'s Happening\" \r\nsection of the NBPTS web site, www.nbpts.org, for a list of rewards and \r\nincentives.) And in some areas, teachers who earn National Board \r\nCertification are playing leadership roles in teacher training, student \r\nassessment, curriculum development, and the evaluation of non-tenured \r\nteachers. Genevieve Gillen, an English teacher at George Washington \r\nCarver Middle School in Miami, is one such teacher .. Gillen is working \r\nwith teacher educators at the University of Miami to infuse the university\'s \r\nteacher education program with NBPTS objectives. \"The more that \r\nhappens,\" says Gillen, \"the easier it will be for younger teachers to see \r\nNational Board Certification as a natural extension of their training, an \r\n\r\n16 \r\n\r\n\r\nNationalBoaniforPlrfe.r.!ionalTeochingStandtmJs \r\n\r\non-going professional growth experience.\" \r\n\r\nPersonal accomplishment. National Board Certification requires a con\r\n\r\n\r\nsiderable commitment of time, money, and effort, but like many chal\r\n\r\n\r\nlenging endeavors, completing it can be very satisfying. Bruce Boehne of \r\n\r\nRamona, Calif, put it this way: \"I have a deep feeling of accomplishment \r\n\r\nin achieving National Board Certification that can never be taken away. \r\n\r\nWhen I have \'bad\' days, the thought that I have something behind me \r\n\r\nthat shows I really am an accomplished educator is a good feeling to fall \r\n\r\nback on, and it always lifts my spirits. The huge amount oftime and effort \r\n\r\nspent to accomplish this was definitely worth it.\" \r\n\r\nChanging the culture of the school. Ever since the publication of A \r\n\r\nNation at Risk in 1983, education has been the target of one reform ini\r\n\r\n\r\ntiative after another. Generally mandated from the top down, these ini\r\n\r\n\r\ntiatives have largely failed to make any real difference in the way schools \r\n\r\nwork-or in the results they produce. But by giving teachers the major \r\nrole in designing a system that recognizes accomplished teaching, National \r\nBoard Certification has put in place a bottom-up reform strategy \r\n. that promises lasting change. \"National Board Certification is different \r\nfrom run-of-the-mill reforms primarily because it will cause teachers like \r\nme to look critically at their own\" practice,\" wrote David Haynes, a \r\nteacher-in-residence at the National Board and a member of the Early \r\nAdolescence/Generalist Standards Committee. \"This kind of critical \r\n. reflection is important not only for individual teachers but also for the \r\n\r\n17 \r\n\r\n\r\nAmerironFederation rfTearkrs \r\n\r\n\r\nentire educational process in our country.\" \r\n\r\nOther teachers agree. \"I cannot ask myself why I do a particular thing \r\nand how I might do it better and then go to a team meeting and not ask \r\nthe same questions of my colleagues,\" said Karen Bean, ofBethel, Maine. \r\n\'\'As I change, those around me are affected. The culture in the school \r\nbegins to change; teachers don\'t do things just because they always have, \r\nbut rather they begin to examine what they do.\" \r\n\r\nRecognizing the power of the National Board Certification process, \r\nteacher educators and school administrators are beginning to incorpÂ·orate \r\nthe standards into pre-service and in-service programs and beginning to \r\nadopt standards-based performance assessment strategies. But the real \r\nreform starts in the classroom, where teachers like the ones quoted here \r\nare bringing a heightened professionalism to the complex and rewarding \r\nwork of teaching and learning. \r\n\r\n18 \r\n\r\n\r\nNational&an:lforPrrfoionaITeodingStandanir \r\n\r\n\r\nAm I ready for National Board \r\nCertification? \r\n\r\nJust because you meet the eligibility requirements does not necessarily \r\nmean you\'re ready for National Board Certification. Only you can \r\nanswer that question. A good way to begin is with a careful review of the \r\nstandards in your field. For each standard, try to formulate specific \r\nanswers to these questions: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ What do I know with respect to this standard? \r\nâ€¢ What am I able to do with respect to this standard? \r\nâ€¢ How might I demonstrate proficiency in this standard? \r\nâ€¢ How could I prove to colleagues that I meet this standard? \r\nMany teachers find it helpful to work through this process with one \r\n\r\nor more colleagues, and many also find it helpful to ask for advice and \r\n\r\nsuggestions from teachers who have earned National Board Certification. \r\n\r\n(For a state-by-state list of these teachers, see the \"Where It\'s Happen\r\n\r\n\r\ning\" section of the NBPTS web site, www.nbpts.org.). \r\n\r\nConsider, too, whether this is the right point in your career or the best \r\n\r\ntime in your personal life to commit yourself to the challenging and time\r\n\r\n\r\nconsuming certification process. You might also want to take into consid\r\n\r\n\r\neration whether an organized support system is available to you through \r\n\r\nyour union, your school district, a local teacher center, or a nearby univer\r\n\r\n\r\nsity. The presence of even an informal network of supportive colleagues \r\n\r\nand mentors can make a real difference in how you approach the certifi. \r\ncation process. \r\n\r\nFinally, a.sk yourself honestly whether you are prepared to handle the \r\n\r\npossible disappointment ifyou do not earn certification-as well as the \r\n\r\npossible resentment of others ifyou do. \r\n\r\n19 \r\n\r\n\r\nAmeritanFederationrjTeadm \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat ifl decide I\'m not ready? \r\n\r\n\r\nEven ifyou decide not to stand for National Board Certification, you \r\ncan still take advantage of the professional consensus that resides in the \r\nstandards documents. Studying the standards is like entering into an \r\nintensive dialogue with master teachers in your field. The standards \r\nreflect best practices without being prescriptive, capturing the underlying \r\nknowledge, principles, philosophies, assumptions, and expectations that \r\ncharacterize accomplished practice.

At the same \r\ntime, new cognitive research suggests that \r\nteaching practice should be radically altered \r\nto treat all students more as apprentices \r\nwho learn to know, think, and do-all \r\nat the same time. \r\n\r\nBoth sets ofreforms will demand much \r\nmore of teachers, including a deeper knowledge \r\nof subject matter; a better understanding \r\nof how students learn, the ability to \r\nmake complex, impromptu deciSions, and a \r\n\r\ncommitment to working closely with colleagues \r\nto design rich learning activities \r\nand new assessments. \r\n\r\nWithout professional development, \r\nschool reform will not happen. Professional \r\ndevelopment can no longer be viewed as a \r\ndispensable appendage that can be cut at \r\nwill or an activity that can be isolated from \r\nthe achievement of comprehensive or \"systemic\" \r\nreform. The nation can adopt rigorous \r\nstandards, set forth a visionary scenario, \r\ncompile the best research about how \r\nstudents learn, change the nature of textbooks \r\nand assessment, promote teaching \r\nstrategies that have been successful with a \r\nwide range of students, and change all the \r\nother elements involved in systemic reform. \r\n\r\nPrinciples for Professional Development / AFT \r\n\r\n1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, unless the classroom teacher understands \r\nand is committed to the plan and \r\nknows how to make it happen, the dream \r\nwill come to naught. The magnitude of \r\nchange sought demands a carefully crafted, \r\nwell-supported professional development design. \r\n\r\n\r\nTraditional staff development has \r\nfailed. There are documented cases in \r\nwhich teachers set out to change what \r\nthey did, believed they were making significant \r\nchanges in practice, but, in fact, \r\ndid not. There are also large numbers of \r\nteachers who make little effort to change \r\nbecause they consider \"inservicing\" \r\nworthless and don\'t know where else to \r\nturn for support. We believe these results \r\nmost often occur when: \r\n\r\n1) professional development experiences \r\nare not deep enough, or varied \r\nenough, or well-enough supported; \r\n\r\n2) school policy and organization are at \r\nodds with new theory; \r\n\r\n3) in some way, individual and/or collective \r\nconcerns are ignored; and \r\n\r\n4) the school or district accepts and promotes \r\nthe latest \"catch phrase\" fad \r\nwithout fully understanding it and \r\nwithout considering its implications \r\nfor teachers and students in daily and \r\nlong-term contexts. \r\n\r\nIt is also cl~ar, however, that other \r\nconditions must exist for even the best \r\nprofessional development to make an impact \r\non students. No matter how hard \r\nteachers work or how perfected their \r\nstrategies, student achievement does not \r\nimprove unless students work hard. A \r\nprerequisite for real improvement \r\nin student achievement is \r\nto establish real stakes for studenls. \r\nGrade-to-grade promotion, graduation, \r\ncollege entrance, and access to \r\n\r\nA \r\nprerequisite \r\n\r\nfor real \r\nimprovement \r\nin student \r\nachievement \r\nis to establish \r\nreal stakes for \r\nstudents. \r\n\r\njobs and good job training programs \r\nshould be substantially influenced by students\' \r\nachievement and effort in school. \r\nConsequences-and early assistancealso \r\nmust be develope~ that have an impact \r\non those young people who see no \r\npromise for themselves in college or jobs \r\nand who are often lured into dangerous \r\nor criminal activities that bring instant \r\ngratification. \r\n\r\nA second prerequisite is the \r\nexistence of incentives for \r\n\r\n.,.\r\n\r\nteachers to risk the stages of \r\nuncertainty that surround the \r\ndevelopment of different \r\npractice. Incentives might include: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nthe chance to be engaged with ideas \r\nand colleagues as part ofthe normal \r\nworkday; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nthe availability of clear and credible \r\nsupports; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nopportunities to share expertise as \r\n\r\nteacher leaders, specialists, and \r\n\r\nmentors; \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nopportunities to participate in profes-\' \r\nsional activities outside the district; \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nprofessional recognition; and/or \r\nâ€¢ \r\nfinancial rewards. \r\nA third prerequisite is that educators \r\nmust be convinced that \r\nany proposed change isn\'t iust \r\nanother fad. Otherwise, they will ig\r\n\r\n\r\nnore it and wait for it to go away. So, it is \r\nimportant that the schools and school \r\ndistricts not only endorse change and innovation \r\nrhetorically, but that they make \r\nappropriate, long-term organizational accommodations \r\nto support the change. \r\nThis does not mean an inflexible commitment \r\nto a path that is eventually \r\nfound to be ineffective. But there must \r\nbe an initial realistic view of how much \r\n\r\nPrinciples for Professional Development / AFT \r\n\r\n2 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ· . handle at onceof \r\nplanning and \r\nteachers to \r\n\r\nnecessary to \r\nof new \r\nalso should be \r\nand all school staff \r\n\r\nfor what students \r\n\r\nÂ·\'iUUI..l\\:.. \" \r\n\r\nto exchange classroom \r\ncollaborate on the lessons \r\n\r\nty to change how time is alwithin \r\na school day and year; \r\n\r\nt of the way student work is \r\n\r\nwith curriculum goals; \r\n\r\n. and school evaluation plan \r\n.is supportive of change; \r\n\r\nof a reasonable plan for disciand \r\nsafety; and \r\n\r\neducation and involvement pro-\r\n\r\nis also crucial that professional de-\r\n\r\nIt is crucial \r\n\r\nthat \r\nprofessional \r\ndevelopment \r\n\r\nfor teachers \r\nbe complemented \r\nby \r\nprofessional \r\ndevelopment \r\nopportunities \r\nfor paraprofessionals \r\nand other \r\nschool staff. \r\n\r\nvelopment for teachers be complemented \r\nby professional development opportunities \r\nfor paraprofessionals and \r\nother school staff. Because the teacher/ \r\npara team is such an important one, it \r\nwill sometimes and under certain conditions \r\nmake sense for professional development \r\nactivities to include both groups \r\ntogether. Absent coordinated development \r\nopportunities for all, staff may find \r\nthemselves at cross-purposes to the detriment \r\nof students. \r\n\r\nGiven these supportive and nonthreatening \r\nconditions, teachers should \r\nresponsibly adjust practice based on \r\nsound evidence ofwhat works. \r\n\r\nHowever, making the change to reflective \r\npractice and to the different instructional \r\nroles that current knowledge \r\nsuggests is not easy. For so long, teachers \r\nhave been told what to think and what to \r\ndo. \r\n\r\nTo make ongoing professional development \r\nmore effective in the long run, \r\nwe recommend that preservice courses \r\nprepare teachers to meet the standards \r\nbeing devised by the Interstate New \r\nTeacher Assessment and Support \r\nConsortium (INTASC). This guide to \r\nwhat beginning teachers should know \r\nand be able to do outlines not only a . \r\nsolid foundation of content and pedagogy \r\nfor beginning teachers but also sets standards \r\nfor continuous reflection on practice \r\nand the continuous learning that is \r\nits result. Professional development \r\nshould also help prepare new teachers \r\nwho choose to eventually sit for the advanced \r\ncertification offered by the \r\nNational Board for Professional Teaching \r\nStandards (NBPTS). \r\n\r\nTo assist in the establishment of effective \r\nprofessional development in every \r\nschool district, the American Federation \r\nofTeachers has prepared the following \r\nset of guidelines. \r\n\r\nPrinciples for ProfessIonal Development / AFT \r\n\r\n3 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Guidelines \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrofessional development is a continuous process \r\nof individual and collective examination of \r\npractice. It should empower individual educators \r\nand communities of educators to make \r\n\r\ncomplex decisions, identify and solve problems, and connect \r\ntheory, practice, and student outcomes. It should \r\nalso enable teachers to offer students the learning \r\nopportunities that will prepare them to meet world-class \r\nstandards in given content areas and to successfully \r\nassume adult responsibilities for citizenship and work. \r\n\r\n,. Proiessional \r\ndevelopment sltould \r\nensure deptlt of \r\ncontent knowledge. \r\n\r\nWIly tltis is needed: Some argue \r\nthat \"teachers teach children, not content.\" \r\nWhat matters most, the argument goes, is a \r\nteacher\'s compassion for and understanding \r\nof his students, along with a good grasp of \r\nthe child development field. Others argue \r\nthat there is now so much knowledge that \r\nschools should focus primarily on teaching \r\nchildren how to find information instead of \r\nteaching them particular bodies of knowl~ \r\nedge. They argue that \"learning to learn\" is \r\nenough. \r\n\r\nWe do not agree with either of these arguments. \r\nKnowledge of a common core of \r\n\r\ncontent-which we define as including the \r\n\"various ways of knowing\" that are intrinsic \r\nto each discipline-allows us to communicate, \r\nto work together toward common ends, \r\nto function as a cohesive democratic society, \r\nand to find common ground on which to \r\nbuild tolerance for our differences. \r\n\r\nW1raf if means: Since those who do \r\nnot know content cannot teach it, a prime \r\npurpose of professional development must \r\nbe deepening the content knowledge of \r\nteachers. There are times when teachers \r\nshould be engaged in acquiring knowledge \r\nabout the subject matter they teach, learning \r\ncontent for the sake of knowing the content. \r\nSometimes additional content is learned in \r\nconjunction with developing pedagogical \r\ncontent knowledge. But the learning of content \r\nas a primary goal is a legitimate and necessary \r\nend of professional development. \r\n\r\nPrinciples for Professional Development/ AFT \r\n\r\n4 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na strong \r\n\r\nIâ€¢â€¢~~\" in \"\'e \r\n\r\nof \r\n\r\n..... disciplines. \r\n\r\nis needed: While knowing \r\n. . teach is critical, you must \r\nto get students to understand \r\npossess deep knowledge of \r\n. . but cannot convey that \r\nor engage them in ways \r\n\r\nto absorb it themselves. \r\npossible to be master of spebut \r\nnot know when it is ap\r\n\r\n\r\n. them to generate knowledge \r\nin a discipline. \r\n\r\ntll.etIlIlJJ:While some pedagog. \r\nis applicable to the teaching \r\nexample, the need to \r\nthat help maintain orderand \r\nthinking is embedded in \r\nPeople don\'t underthe \r\nsame way they under. \r\nHaving the ability to solve ~ x \r\n\r\nWhile \r\nknowing the \r\ncontent you \r\nteach is \r\ncritical, you \r\nmust also \r\n\r\ncontent knowledge.

This should be particularly \r\ntaken into account when \"integrated\" or \r\n\"interdisciplinary\" teaching is planned. It is \r\nimportant that the core concepts and knowledge \r\nof the underlying disciplines be addressed \r\nin powerful and not simply superficial \r\nways. It is not sufficient, for example, to \r\nhave students identify the flora in a particular \r\nregion that is the focus of an interdisciplinary \r\nunit when they ought to be actively investigating \r\nthe principles of plant growth \r\nand how climate and geography modify plant \r\nstructure . \r\n\r\n3.

Since learning cannot \r\ntake place in chaos, they must know how to \r\nmanage a classroom full of youngsters, \r\n\r\nKnowledge about how schools work as \r\ninstitutions provides another necessary resource \r\nfor school staffs, as more and more \r\ndecisions shift to school sites, Even the best \r\nintentions and the most able teachers may \r\nnot succeed if placed in a school structure or \r\nculture that is in conflict with their goals. \r\nFurthermore, the professional teacher who \r\nhas knowledge of what is necessary for successful \r\nteaching and learning should be able \r\nto help shape the school environment and \r\nculture, \r\n\r\nWhat it mea_: In addition to the \r\ntopics cited above, professional development \r\n\r\nPrinciples for ProfessIonal Development / AFT \r\n\r\n5 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould provide research-based and practice\r\n\r\n\r\nrelated knowledge about: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\ncreating and maintaining appropriate, orderly \r\nteaching and learning environments; \r\nâ€¢ \r\ncurriculum and assessment issues; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nhow schools function as institutions; and \r\nâ€¢ \r\nhow cultures that support reflective and \r\nresearch-based practice can be built and \r\nsupported. . \r\n4. Effective professional \r\ndevelopment \r\nis rooted in and \r\nreflects tlte best \r\navailable researclt. \r\nWhy fII;s is needed: No other profession \r\nignores its proven knowledge base. \r\nResearch is available and is constantly developing \r\nnew knowledge in all the areas we \r\nhave cited. For too long, educators have been \r\nprone to make instructional decisions with \r\nno more basis than tradition or feelings. The \r\nprofession must apply research-based knowledge \r\nif it is to prepare the current and coming \r\ngenerations of students for the future. \r\nNot only must schools and school districts \r\ntap this research in shaping their professional \r\ndevelopment programs, but good learning \r\ntheory should also be applied to the delivery \r\nof these programs. \r\n\r\nWltaf ;f means: Significant changes of \r\npractice should not be instituted on the basis \r\nof unfounded preferences or because a particular \r\nidea is publicized in education or \r\nother circles. Practice should be examined \r\nand change considered on the basis of sound \r\nresearch to which professionals have access, \r\nand which the practicing professional can \r\nthen use to make decisions. All learners learn \r\nbest when provided with models and examples \r\nand not theory alone. Therefore, when \r\nprofessional development itself models the \r\nkinds of strategies that research finds effective \r\nfor learning, the ability of teachers to \r\nimplement those strategies in class is \r\nstrengthened. \r\n\r\nFor too long, \r\neducators \r\nhave been \r\nprone to \r\nmake \r\ninstructional \r\ndecisions \r\nwith no more \r\nbasis than \r\ntradition or \r\nfeelings. \r\n\r\n5. Professional \r\ndevelopment sltoul\" \r\ncontribute to \r\nmeasurable \r\nimprovement in sludent \r\nacltievement. \r\nWhy fII;s ;s needed: Higher student \r\nachievement is our central goal. Much past \r\nprofessional development has not produced \r\nchanges in practice that resulted in improved \r\nstudent performance. The public and its representatives \r\nrightly expect the public schools \r\nto meet the challenges of educating the nation\'s \r\nchildren. \r\n\r\nWhaf If means: Professional development \r\nmust be powerful enough to result in \r\nchanges in schools and practice that lead to \r\nhigher student achievement on measures acceptable \r\nboth to the public and to the profession. \r\nBut the caveats of our opening section \r\nstill hold. Designs for assessing the impact \r\nof professional development on students \r\nmust account for the students\' share of the \r\nwork. Student effort must complement good \r\nteaching to produce results. \r\n\r\nStudent achievement is not the only relevant \r\nmeasurable outcome. So is teacher practice \r\nitself There are practices that have been \r\nfound to make a difference in student \r\nachievement. Professional development \r\nshould enable teachers to use these practices \r\neffectively. Many of these are contained in \r\nthe standards for highly accomplished teachers \r\ndeveloped by the National Board for \r\nProfessional Teaching Standards (NBPTS). \r\nThus, professional development that enables \r\nincreasing numbers of teachers to gain advanced \r\ncertification or that helps the majority \r\nof teachers come closer to meeting those \r\nstandards is on the right track toward raising \r\nstudent achievement. \r\n\r\nPrinciples for Professional Developmenf / AFT \r\n\r\n6 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntltis is needed:Teachers want \r\nII IIIMU~~ professionals who deliver \r\n\r\nâ€¢. \r\npossible education for their stuthey \r\nare often excluded from the \r\n.Ull-llJ.<1NllL/\", processes regarding policies} \r\nor methodologies. \"Theirs is not to \r\nis too pervasive a point of view \r\nLtcILl1.C:H) among decision-makers.

Such a situation \r\nwastes both time and money. Their cynicism \r\nis magnified by the failure of most such experiences \r\nto take into account the realities of \r\nthe classroom and the differences in teacher \r\nexperiences. Credibility is also compromised \r\nwhen representatives of teachers are brought \r\nin to rubber stamp what someone else has already \r\ndesigned and when these representatives \r\nare such a small fraction of the planning \r\ngroup that they clearly can exert no influence. \r\n\r\n\r\nWIIat it means: It is important that \r\npractitioners be centrally involved in formulating \r\nprofessional development plans and \r\nthat they \"buy in\" to the process.

There are \r\na variety of experiences that are necessary to \r\nclarify, connect, solidify, and develop knowledge. \r\nFor professional development to be \r\ncomplete, all these aspects should be addressed. \r\n\r\n\r\nWIIat it means: Not only should \r\nthere be variety within and among professional \r\ndevelopment courses, but professional \r\ndevelopment should also extend beyond formal \r\ncoursework. So long as the components \r\naddressed in the preceding criteria are met, \r\nrich professional development can occur \r\nwhile educators are networking and participating \r\nin collaboratives, in standards development, \r\ncurriculum and assessment work, \r\nconducting research, or while they are engaging \r\nin the rigorous advanced certification \r\nprocess of the National Board for \r\nProfessional Teaching Standards. Preparation \r\nfor certification by the NBPTS is an excellent \r\nform of professional development, as \r\nmany who have attempted certification will \r\nattest. When there are clearly articulated, \r\nhigh standards for student achievement and \r\nwhen conversations take place about how to \r\nhelp students reach them, professional development \r\nis taking place, whatever the formal \r\nor informal mechanisms that enable this to \r\nhappen. The very organization of the school \r\nshould promote and provide for continuous \r\nand serious reflection about what students \r\nare learning and what needs to be done to \r\ncontinually improve. \r\n\r\n* * * \r\n\r\nFor more information or to comment on \r\nthese guidelines, contact Alice Gill in the AFT \r\nEducational Issues Department, 555 New \r\nJersey Ave., N.W, Washington, DC 20001. \r\n\r\nPrinciples for Professional Development / AFT \r\n\r\n8 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.

Implementation of this program demonstrates that both \r\nLCEA and the School Board are vitally interested in offering innovative \r\napproaches to teacher effectiveness. \r\n\r\nThe ER&D project, begun in 1981, is unique in that it represents the \r\nfirst time a teacher\'s union has ,served as a condu:Lt between educational \r\nresearch and\" practicing teachers. The model allows teachers to work \r\nwith the research, transforming it into a useful tool for everyday \r\nclassroom teaching and learning. This project is a long-term professional \r\nplan. \r\n\r\nIn Lake County, an innovative program has been initiated which will \r\nprovide for teachers to attend ER&D training in a series of six all-day \r\nworkshops, with substitutes provided jointly by the Board and funding \r\nfrom private foundations arranged by AFT. A different piece of research \r\nde~ling with teacher effectivene~s or classroom management will be \r\nstudied at each session and taken back to the clas~room by each teacher \r\nto implement as s (h)e chooses. \r\n\r\nThe program involves the selection of tea,chers to be trained .as TRL\' s \r\n(Teacher Research Linkers) who will serve as ,trainers and workshop \r\nleaders for their peers in their own schools. These TRL\'s will receive \r\nin-service points toward re-certification upon completion of the course. \r\n\r\nThe ER&D Project is designed to promote a non-threatening atmosphere, \r\n\r\nfree of mandates. The emphasis is on the personal, professional choice \r\nof the teacher in regard to the application of the research. \r\n\r\nm~~Q~@~&~Â©(!JJrru1fW------------\'-\" \r\nm~~ &@J~@iJ(@rru ~_OÂ©iJ_O@(fi),---___-.J \r\n\r\nP.O.

The needs of today\'s teaching \r\nprofeasionals have grown beyond the tradnional rOle of a labor union. Teachers want more than betÂ· \r\nter salariee and the right to strike. They want to be treated as profeasionals; they want to be able \r\nto make deci,ions that affect their everyday life in the classroom; they want to help shape a better \r\nsystem of education for our youngsters; they want respect from the community; they want to take \r\npride in their work. . \r\n\r\nThe needs of tomorrow\"teachlng professionals will continue to change as a new breed of teachers \r\nenters the profeasion wnh different expectations and demands. \r\n\r\nThe MFT recognizee the expanding needs of those we serve and of the teaching profeesion in \r\ngeneral. Not only doee our organization stand ready to change wnh the times, but the MFT also plans \r\nto be in the forefront of that change. We believe n\'s time for teachere to tum the agenda for public \r\neducation for everyone. Too often plans have been drawn up without Input from teachers and the \r\nonly option for us Is to react to someone else\'s proposal. \r\n\r\nThis report, \"Striking a Better Bargain,\" represents a slxÂ·month effort by the MITs Task Force \r\non the Future of Education to fashion a posnlon paper that will help lay the groundwork for the future \r\nof education in Minnesota and the teaching profeeslon. \r\n\r\nMany of the issues dlscuased in this draft report are onee that MFT has long held as goals to work \r\ntoward. Other issues are new and may be controversial to our own members and to other educatora. \r\nSome have been put forth in other reports and \"Striking a Batter Bargain\" relterstee those Ideas. \r\n\r\nthis report Is just the beginning. It has not officially been adopted by MFT members. The MFT \r\nis not a tOjHlown organization. We want this plan for quality education to reflect the opinions of education\'s \r\npractitioners -classroom teachers. \r\n\r\nThe MFT Executive Council and the MFT Task Force on the Future of Education Dresent.t!lne \r\n\r\nideas to stimulate dlscuaslon and to encourage MFT officers, locals, area councils, and IndIVIdual \r\nmembers to offer suggestions and additions. The Task Force will then revise this report and present \r\nit to the MFT Spring Convention in April. \r\n\r\nBecause of the deadllnee invOlved, comments must be received in the MFT office by March 10. \r\nWe encourage MFT locals and area councils to schedule special meetings to go through this report, \r\ncarefully consider the ideas, and form a written response by the March deadline. \r\n\r\nWhen it is officially adopted as MFT policy, the report will be the basis for immediate and longrange \r\nplanning. Our committeee will look at ways to implement the ideas presented. As a teachers\' \r\norganization representing t 8,000 members, the MFT will use all of ita available resources to help \r\nbring about needed change In the profeaslon and the educelion system. . \r\n\r\nWe k.-the MFT Is not alone In this campalgn.

Fundamental \r\n10 a democracy is an educaled cnlzenry capable \r\n\r\nof making informed judgments on public issues and a quali. \r\nty workforce to provide a sound economic base. \r\n\r\nWe are living in a Hme when tlchnology hal broughl about \r\nunprecedanted change..As.a resuh, aociely must once agaln \r\nface up to the challenge of updating and restoring public \r\neducalion. As a professional union. we take the common \r\nsense view that real and meaningful changes can only ocÂ· \r\ncur_eleaming taxes place _ in the school building, \r\nin the classroom. or in the refationshlp between student and \r\nteacher. \r\n\r\nCentral to education are teachers and their Sluden~. The \r\n104FT is a profeSSIOnal union represenllng educalOrs. We \r\nbelieve that society needs better schools and Ihat we can \r\nhave Ihem. We must be eager to change and ba willing to \r\nwork vigorously for constant improvement. \r\n\r\nAs 104FT celebrates ItS 50th anniversary. we issue Ihese \r\nrecommendalions on behalf of Ihe praclilioners -Ihe \r\nteachers. We believe Implementing these recommendations \r\nwill significantly improve education and thereby increase \r\npublic education\'s contribulion 10 society in Ihe 21st cenlury. \r\n\r\nRESTRUCTURE THE CAREER OF TEACHING \r\n\r\nINTRODUCTfON: \r\n\r\nCentral 10 educational eHectiveness sland the leacher and \r\n\r\nthe environment in which teachers and learners work. \r\n\r\nReports have pointed 10 the weaknesses In loday\'s educaÂ· \r\ntional system. Piecemeal reform and Ihe addition of more \r\nmoney alone as suggested in the first wave of reform reports \r\nwill not be enough 10 solve Ihe problems of an imminenl exÂ· \r\nplosion In Ihe dem4nd for leachers. Polentialleacher canÂ· \r\ndidates have a multitude of career options and may be atÂ· \r\ntracled 10 olher professions Ihal oHer Ihe prospecls of \r\nsuperior salaries. attractive working conditions. and opporÂ· \r\ntunities for advancement and recognition. \r\n\r\nIf society is to meetlhe challenges fsclng educalion loday, \r\n\r\nbuild upon its strengths. and overcome i~ weaknesses. a m .. \r\n\r\njor restructuring of the leaching profesSion is imperative. \r\n\r\nChildren. our most valuable resource. deserve 10 be laught \r\n\r\nby brighl, capable. challenging leachers. \r\n\r\nMARCH,1916 \r\n\r\nGOAL: RECRUIT HfGHLY QUAUFIED PEOPLE INTO THE \r\nTEACHING PROFESSION \r\n\r\nRATIONALE: \r\nThe demand for leachers is about 10 explode. virtually \r\ndoubling to a need for t.3 million new leschers by 1990. This \r\nexplosion in demand is only pertly due 10 an acceleralion in \r\nlhe reUrement rate of the current tsaching force and a modest \r\nincrease in the number of elemenlary and secondary age \r\nchildren. More importantly, thia acceleraled demand will be \r\nfueled by the dramatic reduClion in lelented. dedicaled candidates \r\nwho will choose leaching as a career. Evidence clearÂ· \r\nIy shows Ihattoday\'s teacher applicants are less academically \r\nlalenled than Iheir counlerparts who choose other professions. \r\nToday\'s tescher applicants also display less academic \r\ntalent than current members of the teachIng force. \r\nPreviously. low teachers\' salaries were eIther overlOOked \r\nor accepled by polenlial leachers because of the personal \r\nsatisfaction of teaching or its respected status in the com~ \r\nmunity. This is no longer Ihe case. Compelenl people. including \r\nwomen and minorities. traditionally riCh sources of \r\nthe labor supply in education. now choose other occupations \r\ndue 10 a startling lack of ragard for leaching. In a 1969 Gallop \r\nPoll.. 75% of Ihe respondents indicaled they would like their \r\nchild 10 pursue acareer in leaching. In 1984. only 45% gave \r\nthis answer. \r\nThe \"graying\" of Ihe faculty and sleady increases in Ihe \r\nschool age population creale not only a problem. bul also \r\na window of opportunity. Changes Ihal are made now in the \r\nrecruitment and education of new teacher candidates can af~ \r\nfecllhe qualily of Ihe teaching profession and Ihe polentlal \r\nquality of our instructional program for years to .come. . \r\nRecasting teaching inlO a highly respected. highly trainÂ· \r\ned. fairly compensaled profession will require far.reaching \r\nchanges in the structure and governance of schools. There \r\n.viII be impllcalions for Ihe community allarge. local school \r\nboards. teacher training Institutions. state boards ot educaÂ· \r\ntlon. legislatures. and teachers themselves. This is a \r\nchallenge Ihal cannol go unmel. \r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \r\n\r\n1. Establish ngorous entry requirements. \r\nFor example: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nmaintain at least a \"8\" averagej \r\nâ€¢ \r\nbe in Ihe upper one-half on SAT or ACT lesls: \r\nMarc:ia A nrtoooll. dIaJr of 1M MFJ\' TIIk oa \r\ntile Fa..... of Edaaltioa. lalrOdaced tile dnft of \r\n\"SIrikIaI â€¢ littler 1IarpIa\" to MFI\' Qd\'.ST ....... \r\nIIdpull.

Monnor and control supply and demand ensuring jObS \r\nand security for Ihose who enler lhe profession. \r\n4. Improve teacher training. \r\nFor example: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nmake teacher training a 5-6 year developmenta~ \r\nprogram prior to full certification status: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nmake teacher training more intellectually stimulating. \r\nrelevant to the classroom and geared to practical \r\napplication: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nabolish slale prescribed curriculum for leacher training: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nImplement teacher developed curriculum tor teacher \r\ntraining; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nrequire residencies as a prerequisite lor teacher \r\ncertification: \r\nâ€¢ \r\npromote internships for possible career exploration. \r\n5.

Central \r\n10 that controf is the power to make decisions. \r\nResearch Clearly shows that in order to have a truly efficient \r\nand effeClive operation, those who implement thlplans \r\n\r\nmust make the plans, Participetion in decision-making would \r\ngive teachers a sense of ownershIP of the educational enterprise, \r\na stake in Ihe outcome. Ownership is a powerful \r\nmollvator. . \r\n\r\nBeing part of a decision-making process would improve job \r\nsatisfaction and could be an important factor in maintaining \r\nthe enthusiasm and eHeCliveness 01 those already in \r\nteaching. Teachers are trained experts in dealing with \r\nstudents and are best qualified to make educational \r\ndecisions. \r\n\r\nRECOMMENOATIONS: \r\n\r\n1. Provide teachers the authority to make curricular \r\ndecisions. \r\nFor example: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\ndevelop and design curriculum; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nmake choices available to students within Ihe \r\ncurriculum: r I â€¢ use technology as appropriate wilhin the curriculum; \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\ndevelop individual learning plans; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nselect appropriate textbooks, software, and materials. \r\n2.

Establish teachers as the aulhoritles in making site \r\nmanagement decisions. \r\nFor example: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nallow time for preparallon and coflegial work; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nestablish instructional cabinets: \r\nâ€¢ \r\ndecide class size; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nexamine length of the schoof day and class periods; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nreport pupil progress; \r\n!1 \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nschedule teeching assignments at the grade level and \r\nbuilding level; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nIdentify StIffing needs and prerequisnea, \r\n4. Enaur. that information on teacher involvement In dec~ \r\nlion maJdng is widely distributed, \r\nGOAL: ADDRESS A CtfANGING SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT \r\n\r\nRATIONALE: \r\nThe educator\'s role is inftuenced by societal changes that \r\naHect students, such as working parents, avallabilny of drugs \r\nand aJcohof, early sexual experienCea, and the necessny of \r\nstudents to work. Schools can serve as an intervening force \r\nto ametiorate some of the probfems growing out of theee \r\nsocial changes. PubliC education must cope with the changing \r\nnature of the children n seeks to educate. \r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \r\n\r\nt. Work with afl communny agencies to provide adequate \r\nchild care, especially for: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nchildren of teenagers who are finishing their education; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nunsupervised young children before and aller schoof; \r\nâ€¢ \r\npreschoof age siblinge of students who otherWise would \r\nbe compelled to babysn. \r\n2. Address the problem of teenage pregnancy. \r\nFor example: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nestablish appropriate sex education; \r\nâ€¢ \r\ndevelop appropriate perenting education: \r\nâ€¢ \r\ninclude health Clinics in the junior and senior high \r\nschools. \r\n3. AddresS the problems of drug and chemical abuse. \r\nFor example: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nprovide adequate health counseling and supportservices; , \r\nâ€¢ \r\nprovide education and information about the effects of \r\ndrugs, alcohol, and tobecco produeta; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nestablish strict enforcement of smoking restrictions in \r\nschoofs. \r\n4. Oevetop and support adequate prH8Nfce and in-service \r\neducation for professionals and peraprofessionals to provide \r\nthe resources to counteract the eHeets of social problems encountered \r\nin the classroom. Such training should address \r\nthe issues of: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nchild abuse and negleCl; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nlack of soH esteem; \r\nâ€¢ \r\ndisruptive students; \r\nâ€¢ \r\nemotionally unstable students: \r\nâ€¢ \r\npotential student dropouts. \r\n5. Oevelop and support comprehensive mental and \r\nphysical health awareness programs. \r\nBUILD COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AND RESOURCES \r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION: \r\n\r\nThe most important investment the state and its people can \r\nmake for the future is a strong financial commnment to education, \r\na commitment ensuring that resources not only are \r\navailable but that they are used wisely and eHectively. When \r\nfaced with a scarce resource, industry peys the price \r\nnecessary to produce a quality product.

Greater competition \r\nfor public services for seniors and health care dollars will \r\nmushroom. To sustain public confidence, mterest and suI> \r\nport, public education must work to streamline its operation \r\nin addition to providing effective programs. \r\n\r\nInvofvement of the education community, commitment of \r\nthe public, and leadership of state policy makers are crucial \r\nto help create and sustain Minnesota as amodel of excellence \r\nfor leamers, \r\n\r\nRECOMMENOATIONS: \r\n\r\n1.

This article is written to focus on some \r\nof the current trends in public education in \r\nPennsylvania and in the nation, as well as \r\nto attempt a forecast of where these \r\ntrends will lead in the future. \r\n\r\nAny effort to write about the future of \r\neducation here in our state and in the \r\nnation is a difficult and uncertain undertaking \r\nat best, but there are some things \r\nwhich are happening now and which will be \r\nhappening in the near future that one can \r\nfeel reasonably assured, indeed, will be \r\nsustained and enlarged upon over the long \r\nterm. \r\n\r\nTop Quality Teachers-the Fundamental \r\n\r\nIngredient for Successful Schoo1s \r\n\r\nCertainly, \'in maintaining and striving \r\nto improve the quality and effectiveness \r\nof public education and the support for \r\npublic education among the general public, \r\nthere can be no question that the place \r\n~o start is by assuring the availability \r\nof top quality, well prepared, competent, \r\ncommitted teachers. A major thrust \r\nin our state now and in the immediate \r\nfu.ture, and for the foreseeable future, \r\nwill be to concentrate on trying to recruit \r\nand hold very competent persons to teach \r\nin our classrooms. \r\n\r\nUpcoming Teacher Shortage \r\n\r\nIt\'s no secret that the demographics \r\nof the teaching profession indicate that \r\nthere is going to be an enormous turnover \r\n\r\n\'among current teachers over the next \r\nfive, to seven, to eight years. The estimates, \r\nand they are accurate, are that \r\nin excess of 50% of all the teachers \r\ncurrently teaching will be retired or \r\n\r\notherwise out of teaching inside the \r\nnext ten years. That\'s because a great \r\nbulk of current teachers came into the \r\nprofession in the 1950\'s and the early \r\n1960\'s, and those teachers are now beginning \r\nto near, or are at, retirement age. \r\n\r\nOf course, the factors that were \r\npresent in the past to fill our teaching \r\nranks with very many top quality people \r\nhave changed. For one thing, there np \r\nlonger is a draft. The draft was an \r\ninducement to young men to become \r\nteachers rather than enter military service. \r\nThere is a second factor of much greater \r\nsi~ificance. The teaching profession\' \r\nhas historically been one of the most \r\nattractive professions for women because \r\nmany other professions that should have \r\nbeen open to women really weren\'t open \r\nto them, and, as a consequence, many \r\nwomen came into teaching. We have \r\nan enormous number of very well qualified, \r\nhighly competent women in our profession \r\ntoday, simply because they had not too \r\nmany other choices of professions to \r\nenter. That too has now changed. Women \r\ntoday have a diversity of attractive \r\n\r\n. career choices. \r\n\r\nMoreover, teaching now IS In competition \r\nwith other professions for top quality \r\ncollege graduates-males and females, \r\nminorities, and so on. The number of \r\nyoung adults coming out of our colleges \r\nand universities right now to go into \r\nall kinds of pursuits, not just teaching, \r\nis at a low level in comparison to what \r\nit normally would be, because the \"baby \r\nbust\" generation is now going through \r\nour high schools and entering our colleges â€¢. \r\nSo we have that factor which also influences \r\nhow many people are available \r\nto become teachers. \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\n-1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[l \r\n\r\n\r\nn \r\n\r\n\r\n\\ j \r\n\r\nf \' \r\n\r\nr 1 \r\n\r\n\'[ \r\n\r\nl\' \r\n\r\n, J \r\n\r\n[ ~ \r\n\r\nl, \r\n\r\nl \" \r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nOver the last ten to fifteen years, \r\nthere were\' many layoffs in the teaching \r\nprofession, and for young people about \r\nto enter college orin college, the perception \r\nwas, \"Why prepare to be a teacher, \r\neven if one likes the idea, because there \r\naren\'t any teaching jobs to be had?\" \r\nThat perception was correct. However, \r\nthat perception is no longer correct. \r\nThere will be teaching jobs, so that, \r\nindeed, those who are interested in teaching \r\nwould be well advised to consider \r\nit as a career. \r\n\r\nTeacher Recruitment Program in Effect \r\n\r\nin Pittsburgh \r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note what the \r\nPittsburgh Federation of Teachers, in \r\nconjunction with the Pittsburgh School \r\nDistrict, is doing in the City of Pittsburgh \r\nright now, in terms of the recruitment \r\nof future teachers for the City School \r\nSystem. Pittsburgh is engaged in an \r\neffort to recruit teachers for the City \r\nSchool System from its own high school \r\nstudent body. Last school year, again \r\nthis school year, and next school year \r\nat least, joint presentations---by the \r\nunion and by top school administrationhave \r\nbeen made and will be made to \r\nhbnor roll students in the City\'s high \r\nschools, as well as to some other students \r\nwho may not be on the honor roll but \r\nwho are recommended by their teachers \r\nas potentially very good candidates to \r\nbe future teachers. Excellent high school \r\nstudents in Pittsburgh are being informed \r\nabout the bright prospects that exist \r\nfor jobs in teaching, what the needs \r\nare in teaching, what the importance \r\nof teaching is to our society, and what \r\nthe standards and requirements are for \r\nentering teaching. They are virtually \r\nguaranteed a teaching position in Pittsburgh \r\nand they are guaranteed an exc.ellent, \r\ncompetitive starting salary, rangmg \r\n(in 1990 and 1991) from $23,000 to $27,000, \r\nor higher. \r\n\r\nTough Entry StandardS .n~ \r\n\r\nAttract Top Students .!2 Teaching \r\n\r\nWhen such students are talked with \r\nand informed that the standards for \r\nthe teaching profession are growing \r\nstronger; that, indeed, it will require \r\nin Pennsylvania a Master\'s Degree for \r\npermanent certification as a teacher; \r\nthat in the future there will be a rigorous \r\ntest for various kinds of certification \r\nin teaching; that there already is in our \r\nstate (beginning with the 1987-88 school \r\nyear) a test for all entering teachers; \r\nthat there will be an induction period \r\nfor new teachers-when such students \r\nlearn of these more rigorous requirements \r\nfor the teaching profession and discuss\\ \r\nstronger standards in the teaching profession, \r\nthey are actually more attracted \r\nto consider teaching as one of the alternatives \r\nwhen they look at a potential career. \r\nIf we can assure young people that there \r\nis going to be a job for them, one that \r\nprovides a real service to society and \r\none that will pay a very decent salary, \r\nteaching becomes all the more appealing. \r\nto them as a profession. \r\n\r\nProfessional Teaching Conditions A~ \r\n\r\nIutel! Essential \r\n\r\nIn order for teaching to be attractive \r\nas a profession,not only do the salaries \r\nhave to be satisfactory, obviously, but \r\nconditions in the schools themselves \r\nhave to be the kind that will attract \r\nable and talented people into teaching \r\nand keep them in teaching. Teachers \r\nhave to be able to function in a professional \r\nway in our schools, which they \r\nhave not been able to do at all in the \r\npast. The central thrust today, and in \r\nthe immediate future, will be a genuine \r\nand conscious effort to recruit top quality \r\nyoung people into teaching and, at the \r\nsame time, a strong effort to restructure \r\nteaching into a true profession. \r\n\r\nl , -2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfl \r\n\r\n\r\nr 1 \r\n\r\nI \' \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nt J \r\n\r\n[ J \r\n\r\ni \r\n\r\ni \r\n\r\n, J \r\n\r\nf 3 \r\nI \r\n\r\nI. .J \r\nr ..\" \r\n\r\n, J \r\n\r\n, , \r\nr\' \r\n\r\nc. \r\nr \' \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nr â€¢ \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\nCarnegie Forum Report and Other National \r\n\r\nReports on Education Provide Catalyst \r\n\r\nThe energy to make that pappen \r\nis coming from teachers themselves \r\nand from their teacher organizationsparticularly \r\nfrom the American Federation \r\nof Teachers. Certainly the catalyst \r\nfor all of this effort to professionalize \r\nthe role\' of the teacher in the schools \r\nfundamentally has been the various \r\nnational reports on education that have \r\nbeen issued over the last three years. \r\nThe most important of these is the report \r\nof the \"Task Force on Teaching as a \r\nProfession,\" a distinguished fourteenmember \r\nbody assembled by the \"Carnegie \r\nForum on Education and the Economy.\" \r\n(AI Shanker, AFT national president, \r\nwas one of the members of that Task \r\nForce.) The Carnegie Forum Task Force \r\nreport was issued in the spring of 1986, \r\nand the reaction to that report and the \r\nimpetus from it are still being felt and \r\nare growing stronger. \r\n\r\nNational Teacher Certification Board \r\n\r\nRecommended ~Carnegie Forum \r\n\r\nOne of the recommendations of the \r\nCarnegie Forum is that national teacher \r\ncertification standards be developed \r\nand that a national teacher certification \r\nboard be created. In order to begin to \r\nmake teaching into a profession, professional \r\nentry standards that parallel some \r\nof the kinds of procedures that are followed \r\nin the medical profession, in the legal \r\nprofession, and in other professions need \r\nto be adopted. For example, even though \r\none completes the educational requirements \r\nto become a teacher, he or she \r\nstill should have to pass an entry examination \r\nto actually qualify to be a teacher. \r\nA national test and related professional \r\nstandards will be developed over the \r\nnext three to four years. These professional \r\nstandards and tests will be available \r\nfor individual states to examine and, \r\nhopefully, to adopt. This is all part of \r\nthe effort to strengthen the standards \r\nfor entry into teaching and to improve \r\nthe image and the reality of teaching \r\nas a profession. \r\n\r\nBroadening the \r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers in the Schools \r\n\r\nSo again, the second thing that we \r\nhave to do in assuring that we are going \r\nto get the best people into teaching \r\nand keep them is to strengthen the professional \r\nrole of the teacher in the schools. \r\nIn this\' context, what is happening now, \r\nand will continue to happen. in the \r\nimmediate future, is an effort to try \r\nto have teachers assume broader roles \r\nand responsibilities in our schools-not \r\nnecessarily to have teachers run the \r\nschools totally on their own, but certainly \r\nto have teachers assume the responsibility \r\n(following agreement with the school \r\nboard and top school administration, \r\nas a result of joint meetings and consensu~) \r\nfor a host of professional tasks and \r\nfunctions. Examples of such added teacher \r\nprofessional responsibilities would be: \r\nconducting staff development programsÂ· \r\ninvolving teachers, handling the induction \r\nof new teachers, observing their colleagues \r\nin the classroom, having the time to \r\ninteract with each other in terms of \r\nways of improving instruction in the \r\nschools, and providing an opportunity \r\nto discuss problems in the schools and \r\nhow these problems might best be solved \r\nby teachers themselves. \r\n\r\nWith Teacher Power and Influence Comes \r\nTeacher Responsibility \r\n\r\nIn other words, the objective is to \r\ncreate an atmosphere in the schools \r\nwhere teachers really have an opportunity \r\nto have a direct and meaningful influence \r\non what happens in the school, and, as a \r\nresult of having that influence, teachers \r\nare enabled to broaden their perspective \r\nand really begin to acquire major \r\nresponsibility for improving the atmosphere \r\nin the schools and the educational \r\noutcomes for students in the schools. \r\nThat whole effort is really necessary \r\nif we are ultimately to make teaching \r\n\r\n-3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeac ers\' Teac ers\' \r\ni[ : \r\n\r\n, j \r\n\r\nf ~ \r\n\r\nI \' \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nc J \r\n\r\nr\' \r\n\r\nr\' \r\n\r\nc J \r\n\r\nr \' \r\n\r\nr : \r\nl , \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nL ..i \r\n\r\ninto the kind of attractive profession \r\nthat it really should be in our society. \r\nThis is not going to be an easy goal to \r\nachieve, but we, have an opportunity \r\nover the next five to ten years, t>erhaps \r\nit will take longer, to make teaching \r\ninto one of the top collective employment \r\nprofessions that exist in our nation, if \r\nnot the best of the collective employment \r\nprofessions. \r\n\r\nGrowing Status and Respect for Teaching \r\nProfession \r\n\r\nWe\'ve made some real headway in \r\nterms of salaries for teachers. Certainly, \r\nwith the rights that we have now under \r\ncollective bargaining, teachers are no \r\nlonger a powerless group at all. Teachers \r\nhave strong national teacher organizations, \r\nstate organizations, local bargaining \r\norganizations, and so on. The whole \r\ncollective bargaining process has given \r\nteachers the power within their own \r\nschool districts, and within the states \r\nand nationally as well, to have a truly \r\nstrong influence on what is said about \r\nteaching, on what is said about public \r\neducation, and on what various national \r\nreports recommend for education. The \r\nfact that teachers are in a powerful \r\nP9sition means that those who would \r\nmake recommendations and formulations \r\nfor the future in public education have \r\nto consult with teachers and their representatives \r\nabout what kinds of things \r\nought to be done to safeguard public \r\neducation and to strengthen public education \r\nin our state and in the nation. \r\n\r\nYoung college and university graduates \r\nare going to find, if they go into teaching, \r\nthat teaching will be a much stronger \r\nand, hopefully, a much more respected \r\nprofession in the future than, unfortunately, \r\nit is at present and has been \r\nin the immediate past. \r\n\r\nFocus !!! Entry Salaries ~ \r\n\r\nCertainly the area of salary is a key \r\nconcern-especially the entering salaries \r\nfor teachers. One of the trends in our \r\nstate, and nationally as well, is a recognition \r\nthat one cannot succeed in trying \r\nto draw people into any profession or \r\ninto any occupation unless the salaries \r\nthat are paid are competitive. There \r\nis a recognition that the entering\' salaries \r\nfor teachers, which, in particular, have \r\nalways been low and which are still low, \r\nhave to be greatly strengthened, if, indeed, \r\nwe\'re going to be in a position to attract \r\nthe numbers and the quality of people \r\nwe have to draw into teaching. Therefore, \r\nanother current and continuing trend \r\nwill be the drive to strengthen starting \r\nsalaries for new teachers entering the \r\nprofession. \r\n\r\nCareer Teacher Salaries Always an \r\n\r\nEmphasis \r\n\r\nThere is always a need, and that \r\nsurely must and will continue, for career \r\nteacher salaries to be strengthened as \r\nwell. That effort, through collective \r\nbargaining, will continue. That is a \r\nprimary responsibility that organizations \r\nwhich represent teachers have and it\'s \r\na responsibility that will be met. If \r\nentering salaries are improved, that \r\ncertainly helps to build the pressure \r\nfor increasing the salaries for career \r\nteachers at the same time. \r\n\r\nSummary of Article to this Point \r\n\r\nThis completes the first major area \r\nbeing dealt with in this article-the \r\narea of who teachers will be, what their \r\nprofessional roles and status will be, \r\nand how they will be compensated. This \r\nis one overall major area which is changing \r\ndramatically and which is critical to \r\nthe future of public education in Pennsylvania \r\nand the nation. \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\n-4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrl \r\n\r\n\r\n~ r! \r\n\r\n! \' \r\n\r\n_ \"---_..1 \r\n\r\nr 1, \r\nf i \r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\n~fJ \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nl ) \r\n\r\nr J \r\n\r\ni \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\n, c \r\n\r\nr\' \r\n! \r\n\r\n, j \r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\nL , \r\n\r\nL J \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nEmphasis ~ Educational Quality and \r\n\r\nStudent Achievement \r\n\r\nThere is a second major area on which \r\nthis article must concentrate.Â· That \r\narea, of course, is that schools exist-and \r\nteachers are employed in schools-because \r\nof the needs and interests of the students \r\nin our schools. Clearly, maintaining \r\nand improving the quality of education \r\nis a major concern for the public and \r\nfor parents. If we\'re going to have public \r\nsupport, i.e., taxpayer support, for our \r\nschools, we have to attain educational \r\nresults in the schools that are satisfactory \r\nto the public and that warrant, in the \r\neyes of the public and the parents of \r\nschool children, the continuation and \r\nexpansion of the substantial expenditures \r\nof money that must go into the operation \r\nof effective and successful schools. \r\n\r\nWhat is happening, and what will \r\ncontinue to happen, is that there is a \r\nstrengthening of standards for students \r\nin the schools. We now have in our own \r\nstate, as Pennsylvania teachers know, \r\nmore credits required for high school \r\ngraduation, more rigorous academic \r\nprograms, more testing, and so on in \r\nthe schools. That development al1d that \r\ntr,end really are essential components \r\nof the whole effort to try to maintain \r\nand strengthen public education. This \r\narea is parallel in significance to the \r\nmakeup of the teaching staff itself. \r\n\r\nWinning Public Support for the Sehools \r\n\r\nThere is no question that, to the \r\nextent that the schools are effective, \r\nto the extent that students achieve in \r\nthe schools, and to the extent that teachers \r\nare given the kind of support they need \r\nto make those things happen, a majority \r\nof the public will support our schools \r\nin the future. \r\n\r\nSo the second major thing that is \r\nhappening today is a strengthening of \r\nstandards in our schools, more insistence \r\nthat the reason why children are in schools, \r\nand why teachers are there, is so that \r\nstudents learn and progress. Effective \r\n\r\nlearni~g cannot occur withou orous \r\nacademic program and without satisfactory \r\ndiscipline conditions in the schools. \r\nThere\'s no question that this combined \r\nfactor is a key one-in where we are \r\nin education today and in where we are \r\ngoing. This is true in the minds of teachers \r\nand in the view of parents and the public. \r\n\r\nCritical Need to Pund Education Ade\r\n\r\n\r\nguate1y \r\n\r\nClearly, in order to operate the schools \r\nit is absolutely necessary to have adequate \r\nfinancing of education. Notwithstanding \r\nthe dismal climate at the present time \r\nwith regard to support for public education \r\nat the national level, emanating from \r\nthe White House, the fact is that noiv \r\nand over the upcoming years-particularly \r\nif we\'re successful in the goal of professionalizing \r\nthe role of teachers in the \r\nschools and if we\'re successful in strength-\' \r\nening educational standards and student \r\nachievement-there will be the political \r\nthrust and the public and business commitment \r\nthat are necessary to maintain \r\nand to improve the levels of funding \r\nfor our schools. \r\n\r\nInadequate Level of Federal SUpPOrt \r\n\r\nfor Education \r\n\r\nCertainly there has to be a greater \r\nfederal effort toward funding our schools. \r\nRight now, roughly speaking,6% or so \r\nof all of the funds for operating our \r\nelementary and secondary schools come \r\nfrom the federal government. That, \r\nof course, is truly a very low and dismal \r\nlevel of federal support. That low level \r\nof support, frankly, has been the case, \r\nnot just in this national administration \r\nbut in the past as well. This administration, \r\nhowever, has really sought to go \r\nbackward. Fortunately, its efforts to \r\nreduce drastically the already inadequate \r\nlevel of federal aid were resisted by \r\nothers more wise than the administration, \r\ni.e., the Congress, and the situation \r\nis not as bad as it actually could have \r\nbeen had the President succeeded in \r\nhis damaging intent. \r\n\r\n-5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nr ] \r\n\r\n( i \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nr \' \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nt ] \r\n\r\nr . \r\nl â€¢ \r\n\r\n\\ \" \r\n\r\nL .J \r\nThe recent enactment of a broad-based \r\nfederai tax reform, again despite the \r\nposition of the President, includes the \r\ncontinued full deductibility of state \r\nand local incomeÂ· and wage taxes and \r\nproperty taxes. As a consequence, the \r\nmeans for state and local governments, \r\ni.e., the political means, to continue \r\nto support public schools at least have \r\nbeen held in place, again despite the \r\nopposition of the national administration. \r\nHad the deductibility of state and local \r\nincome and wage taxes and property \r\ntaxes been eliminated, not only would \r\nthat have eliminated the greatest level \r\nof federal support that exists right now, \r\nbut it would have made it very difficult, \r\nif not impossible, for state governments \r\nand local governments to maintain the \r\ntaxes that they currently levy which \r\ngo to support our public schools-i.e., \r\nthe state income tax, local wage taxes, \r\nand, particularly, the local property tax. \r\nIf those taxes were no longer deductible, \r\nthen, obviously, the political ability \r\nto maintain those taxes and, especially, \r\nto increase those taxes when it is essential \r\nto do so would be next to nil. \r\n\r\nAn underlying sentiment of public \r\nsupport already exists to increase the \r\nlevel of federal aid to public education. \r\nThat support can be marshalled, if we \r\ncan get someone to head the next national \r\nadministration who is cognizant of the \r\ncritical nature of public education in \r\nterms of the future of our nation, our \r\nsociety, and our economy. \r\n\r\nStates Continue .!:! Key Source of Financial \r\nSupport for Schools \r\n\r\nFor now, the key area for financial \r\nsupport for our schools will have to come \r\nfrom the state, and there is a trend nationally \r\nfor states to assume an increasing \r\nshare of the funding support that\'s necessary \r\nfor our schools. In our state, somewhere \r\naround 40% to 41 %, or so, of local \r\nschool district budgets, on the average, \r\ncomes from the state. That, in part, \r\nis a result of an inadequate level of state \r\nsupport for our schools, but it\'s also \r\na result of the fact that in our state \r\nwe have a reasonably high per pupil \r\nexpenditure. If there is a higher level \r\n\r\n~r=--//) \r\n\r\nof per pupil expenditure, then it la-i/es \r\nmore money from the state to reach \r\na 50% level of funding. So, we\'re not \r\nwell off, but we\'re not disastrously off \r\nin that whole regard. There\'s absolutely \r\nno question, however, that there will \r\nbe a need in Pennsylvania for a much \r\ngreater measure of financial effort from \r\nthe state in the upcoming years. \r\n\r\nLocal Support for Schools in Pennsylvania \r\n\r\nThe principal level of support for \r\nour schools across the state, because \r\nthe state is not at 50% state funding \r\nfor education, is the local level of \r\nsupport-which is primarily the local \r\nproperty tax. That tax is not a very \r\npopular tax, as all teachers are well \r\naware. But it is absolutely essential \r\nfor the maintenance of our public schools! \r\n\r\nAgain, using the City of Pittsburgh \r\nas an example, the Pittsburgh School \r\nDistrict has substantial property taxes, \r\nas do all other school districts, that \r\ngo to support the public schools. There \r\nare City and County property taxes as \r\nwell. Also in effect in the City of Pittsburgh \r\nis a 4% wage tax; 1 7/8% of that \r\nwage \'tax goes to the schools and 2 1/8% \r\ngoes to the City of Pittsburgh. The \r\nwage tax in the City of Pittsburgh is \r\npaid only by those persons who work \r\nin the City and who are also residents \r\nof the City (as-well as by City residents \r\nwho work outside the City). Consequently, \r\nthere exists a rather narrow population \r\nbase from which to collect the wage \r\ntax. \r\n\r\nObviously, if there are already fairly \r\nconsiderable property taxes a t the local \r\nlevel, and if there is a large number \r\nof senior citizens at the local level, \r\nand if local wage taxes are already in \r\nplace, it is difficult at the local level \r\nto achieve the size of revenues that \r\nis necessary to operate our public schools. \r\nLocal revenue increases, for the same \r\nreasons, are extremely tough to achieve. \r\nThat\'s why the real solution to the problem \r\nof adequately funding our public schools \r\nhas to be found primarily at the state \r\nlevel, but also at the national level~ \r\nin the future. \r\n\r\n-6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nn\r\n\r\nlJ \r\n\r\nr1 \r\n\r\nI \r\nl J \r\n\r\nf\" \r\n\r\ni . \r\n, J \r\n\r\n, \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\n, j \r\n\r\nr\' \r\n\r\nL , \r\nr \' \r\nt ] \r\n\r\nI. , \r\nI -\' \r\n\r\nI, \r\n\r\nI , \r\n\r\nSummary of Need for Adequate F1Dlding \r\n\r\nAny institution or enterprise requires \r\na number of critical ingredients in order \r\nto succeed. It requires competent people \r\nto work in it; it requires public support; \r\nbut it also requires adequate funding. \r\nThat clearly is an area that has always \r\nbeen a problem in public education and \r\nthat right now is a serious problem. \r\nHopefully, given the nature of the various \r\nnational reports referred to earlier in \r\nthis article and given the kind of support \r\nthat\'s coming from the business community \r\nnow for our public schools, the climate \r\nseems to be improving, at least to some \r\nextent, in terms of having the broad \r\nbase of political support that is needed \r\nto provide and assure the revenues that \r\nare necessary to run the schools. \r\n\r\nCollective Bargaining Remains the Base; \r\n\r\nNeed to Go beyond Collective Bargaining \r\n\r\nThe final point that should be made \r\nin this article is that collective bargaining, \r\nvery definitely in our state but in other \r\nstates as well, has been the keystone \r\nfor why teacher organizations have become \r\nstronger and for why teachers are probably \r\nthe best organized and the most organized \r\nprofessional occupation in our nation \r\n\r\n-today. It is also the reason why teachers \r\nhave made considerable personal progress, \r\neconomic and otherwise, over the last \r\ntwenty years or so. That\'s not going \r\nto change. However, in our relationships \r\nwith school districts, while collective \r\nbargaining will certainly be maintained \r\nand built on, most of the professional \r\nand educational progress that we as \r\nteachers are going to need to accomplish \r\nin the schools will have to be achieved \r\nby going beyond collective bargaining-in \r\nterms of our continuing relationships \r\nwith school boards and school administrations. \r\n\r\n\r\n@?~~ \r\nPittsburgh \"Teacher Professionans~ \r\nject\" Exemplifies Cooperative Working \r\nRelationship \r\n\r\nAgain, an example from Pittsburgh \r\nillustrates the need to go beyond collective \r\nbargaining in the effort to professionalize \r\nteaching and to improve public education. \r\nIn the summer of 1985 a contra.ct settlement, \r\nthrough collective bargaining, \r\nwas reached in Pittsburgh. It was a \r\ntwo-year extension of ~n existing agreement. \r\nThe existing agreement was \r\nsupposed to run through August of 1986. \r\nInstead, in August of 1985, a settlement \r\nwas reached in Pittsburgh-a whole \r\nyear early-on a two-year extension \r\nof the existing contract. \r\n\r\nThat contract extension included \r\nsalary increases, fringe benefit improvements, \r\nand some language on. variou.s \r\nitems of concern to teachers and their \r\nunion and to the school district. But, \r\nwhat was most important of all, it was \r\nmutually agreed to start what was called \r\na \"Teacher Professionalism Project,\" \r\nthat would involve a large number of \r\nteachers in the school system, the \r\nadministration, and the school board. \r\nIn this \"Project,\" the many participants \r\nwould talk about a host of issues that \r\ngo far beyond what had ever been able \r\nto be achieved in the collective bargaining \r\nprocess before, issues designed to improve \r\nthe schools, to broaden the role of teachers \r\nin the schools, to change the nature \r\nof the teaching profession in the schools, \r\nand so on. This would all be done through \r\na cooperative, non-adversarial series \r\nof meetings-distinct from collective \r\nbargaining but set in motion by the Pittsburgh \r\nCollective Bargaining Agreement \r\nand relationship. \r\n\r\n-7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPlanting the Historical Adversarial ~Pitts\"!nll!!

This is not \r\nany limited or confrontational collective \r\nbargaining agenda, but a broad professional \r\nand education~ agenda. \r\n\r\nsarial Relationship between Union and \r\n\r\nSchool District \r\n\r\nIn Pittsburgh, as alluded to earlier \r\nin this article, the union and teachers \r\nbegan during the 1985-86 school year \r\nand continued this school year a wideranging, \r\nopen examination of a host \r\nof subjects affecting the professIon and \r\npractice of teaching. Some of these \r\nsubjects are the following: a much broader \r\nprofessional role for teachers in the \r\nschools; the establishment of school \r\ninstructional cabinets at each school, \r\nwherein teachers would meet on a consistent \r\nbasis with the school administration, \r\njointly deal with problems, anc \r\nmutually decide on how the school ought \r\nto be operated; a program for recruiting \r\nnew teachers for the school system; \r\nan approach to having teachers be \r\nresponsible for staff development; and \r\ninstituting and increasing teacher leader \r\npositions in the schools. \r\n\r\nThe basic approach in Pittsburgh, \r\nthrough agreement of the school board \r\nand the school administration with the \r\nunion, was that the parties should cooperate \r\nto try to make meaningful changes \r\nin the schools, with the full involvement \r\nof several hundred teaGhers, not just \r\na few teachers who are on the union \r\nnegotiating committee. The involvement \r\nof a broad group of teachers and administrators \r\nis the surest and best approach \r\nto finding ways to expand the professional \r\nrole of teachers in the schools, to engender \r\nteacher and administrator understanding \r\nand support for such changes, and to \r\ncreate opportunities for teachers to \r\nadvance in their profession without having \r\nto leave the classroom. \r\n\r\n, ; \r\n\r\n-8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1\r\n\r\n\r\n,j \r\n\r\n[j \r\nrl\r\n\r\n\r\nc] \r\n\r\nr 1 \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nr \' \r\n\r\ni \r\n\r\nr \r\n\r\n\r\nr \' \r\n\r\nJ : \r\nl ; \r\n\r\n\\ \' \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\n!. \' \r\n\r\nPrimary Pittsburgh Thrust-opportu\r\n\r\n\r\nnities for Teachers, but without Leaving \r\n\r\nthe Classroom \r\n\r\nThat is the primary, thrust in the \r\nwhole Pittsburgh Teacher Professionalism \r\nProject-to find added responsibilities \r\nfor teachers, some of them promotional \r\nand some of them professional in nature, \r\nbut with the overriding, central requirement \r\nbeing that while various professional \r\nopportunities and responsibilities would \r\nbe introduced and expanded for teachers, \r\nthe affected teachers would still continue \r\nto teach, in some cases full-time, in \r\nother cases part-time. \r\n\r\nChanging Teaching ~a Pull, Career \r\nProfession \r\n\r\nThe developing thrust within the \r\nteaching profession, and what appears \r\nto be the trend for the future in our \r\nstate and nationally, is to find ways \r\nto redefine teaching into a genuine \r\nprofession-by creating opportunities \r\nfor career teachers that do not require \r\nthe participating teachers to leave the \r\nclassroom. The greatest shortcoming \r\nof all in the current structure of the \r\nteaching profession-in terms of the \r\npublic\'s image of teaching as a career, \r\nstudents\' image of teaching as a career, \r\nand teachers\' own personal perception \r\nof teaching as a career-is that the \r\nultimate way today for one to succeed \r\nas a teacher is to get out of teaching. \r\nThat is what we as teachers must change! \r\nThis is what our union, at the local, state, \r\nand national levels, must change! And \r\nthat is what we are trying to change! \r\nIf we look at all of the various national \r\nreports on education, and at the Carnegie \r\nReport in particular, that really is the \r\ncentral theme-thatÂ· teaching must \r\nbecome, within itself, a true profession, \r\nwith professional recognition, professional \r\nresponsibili ty, and prof essional opportunities \r\nfor career teachers! \r\n\r\n~p-/D \r\n\r\nWe must find ways to create more \r\ncareer advancements for teachers that \r\nenable them to continue teaching. In \r\nshort, we must transform teaching into \r\na genuine professional career. In doing \r\nthis, we must redesign the teaching profession \r\nso that teachers really feel that \r\nthey have a fundamental role and a shared \r\nresponsibility in assuring the success \r\nof our schools. That is what is being \r\nattempted in Pittsburgh. That is what \r\nthe thrust will be in Pennsylvania in \r\nthe next five to ten years. The Pennsylvania \r\nFederation of Teachers intends \r\nto continue to work very hard to achieve \r\nthese ends-for teachers, present and \r\nfuture, for the profession of teaching, \r\nand for the more successful education \r\nof all of our students throughout future \r\nyears. \r\n\r\nAlbert Fondy \r\nPaFT President, \r\nMarch-April 1987 \r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * \r\n\r\n[Supplement to this article appears on \r\npages 10 and 11.J \r\n\r\nl ; \r\n\r\n-9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. \r\n. ~P~?J \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Are Teachers, the PaFT, and the AFT Seeking for the Teaching Profession? \r\n\r\nrI \r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nl \r\n. \r\n\\ \r\nJ \r\n\r\nf \r\nJ \r\n\r\ni \r\n\r\n\\ \r\nJ \r\n\r\nIf .~ .. \r\n\r\nl \r\n1 \r\n\r\nr~\' \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nr \' \r\n\r\ni.

They should be viewed as an \r\noptimistic, long-range overview of the \r\nfuture of the teaching profession: \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nTeaching will become a more attractive \r\nprofession, a profession that is truly \r\ncompetitive with other major professions. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nTalented and able college and university \r\nstudents will be drawn to the teaching \r\nprofession. The ranks of talented \r\nfuture teachers will include a sound \r\nbalance between male and. female \r\nteachers and a solid and growing proportion \r\nof minority teachers. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nTeachers will be receiving attractive \r\nand professionally competitive salaries \r\nand fringe benefits, including pension \r\nentitlements, for their services. Professionally \r\ncompetitive salary parameters \r\nwill apply to both entry salaries and \r\nto career salaries. \r\nâ€¢ \r\nComprehensive examinations will be required \r\nfor teachers to enter the teach-\r\ni\'ing profession following \r\ntheir graduation \r\nfrom colleges and universities. (This \r\nelement has already been implemented \r\nin Pennsylvania, with the first tests required \r\nfor all newly certified teachers \r\ncommencing with June of 1987.) \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nTeacher internships will be served \r\nprior to a teacher\'s formal entry into \r\nthe profession. Induction of new teachers \r\nwill be under the direction and \r\nevaluation of especially competent, \r\nexperienced, practicing classroom \r\nteachers. (Teacher induction programs \r\nin each school district are mandated \r\nin Pennsylvania, beginning with the \r\n1987-88 school year.) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nMaster\'s Degrees or other similar \r\nacademic and experience qualifications \r\nwill be required for permanent teaching \r\ncertification. (This is already the \r\ncase in Pennsylvania, with an earned \r\nMaster\'s Degree being required for \r\npermanent certification beginning with \r\nJune of 1987.) \r\nâ€¢ \r\nA national teaching standards and \r\nteacher certification board will develop \r\n. standards, \r\ntests, and certification \r\nrequirements for future teachers, \r\nwhich, in time, will be adopted by \r\nvarious states. These certification \r\nrequirements will include various \r\nspecialty certifications and credentials \r\nfor especially able and/or highly \r\nqualified teachers. (The development \r\nof this board and the accompanying \r\nstandards and procedures is underway \r\nright now, under the sponsorship and \r\nfinancing of the Carnegie Corporation. \r\nThe majority of those engaged in this \r\nsalutary and, it is to be hoped, historic \\ \r\nprocess are outstanding, experienced, \r\npracticing classroom teachers.) \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nPromotional and advancement opportunities \r\nwill be available within the \r\nframework of teaching and the teaching \r\nprofession. Advancement for teachers \r\nwill not primarily be through the route \r\nof leaving teaching for administrative \r\npositions â€¢ \r\nâ€¢ \r\nExcellent teachers, while continuing \r\nto teach either full-time or part-time, \r\nwill achieve positions as the instructional \r\nleaders in their schools, servingÂ· as \r\nlead teachers, department chairpersons, \r\nand in similar capacities as leaders \r\nof instruction. Such positions will \r\nbe part of the faculty makeup at all \r\nschool levels-elementary schools, \r\nmiddle schools, and high schools. \r\nThese positions, when fully developed, \r\nwill include some professional responsibilities \r\npreviously reserved to nonteaching, \r\nsupervisory personnel. This \r\nwill be necessary if teachers are to \r\nachieve real responsibility for the \r\ndelivery and quality of instruction and \r\ntruly are to be the instructional leaders \r\nin the schools. \r\nâ€¢ The \r\nnumber of administrative and nonteaching, \r\nsupervisory positions within \r\npublic education will be reduced, with \r\nteachers and principals working more \r\nclosely and cooperatively and with \r\ngreater autonomy and decision-making \r\nauthority for teachers and for principals \r\nat the school level. \r\n-10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nParaprofessionals, secretarial/clerical If many, or all, of the prece In Jecpersonnel, \r\nand security personnel will tions are to become reality, they will not \r\nbe available in schools in sufficient be achieved on a wide scale in any short \r\n(1 \r\n(1 \r\nnumbers to handle non-professional, \r\n\r\nsemi-professional, and clerical. tasks \r\nin the schools. This will assure that \r\nteachers will be used efficiently and \r\nsolely to teach and otherwise function \r\nin professional areas of responsibility. \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Teachers will be provided the facilities, \r\nassistance, and time to operate as \r\nprofessionals. This includes such \r\nfundamental necessities as clerical \r\naid, paraprofessional help, office space, \r\nwork and conference areas, telephones, \r\nr J duplication equipment, and so on. \r\n\r\ni \r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nComputer, as well as video, audio, \r\nand other technical assistance to\r\n[ J \r\n\r\ni : teachers, to students, and to schools \r\nl J will become a positive and Significant \r\ncontributor to effective teaching,\r\nP learning, and schools. \r\n\r\nl j \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Talented and high quality teachers, \r\n1 , through the medium of their professional \r\nt \r\ni \r\nj organizations, will insist upon and \r\nearn responsibility for and control \r\nr \"\\. of their profession. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Teaching will become a more genuine \r\ni \r\n\' profession, with teachers achieving \r\nthe degree of responsibility and \r\nprofessional autonomy that they have \r\nlong been denied. \r\n\r\nr \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Aspirants to enter the teaching profession \r\nwill come to regard teaching \r\nr â€¢ as a desirable and secure profession, \r\none that contributes profoundly and \r\n\\ \r\n; vitally to the well being of society \r\nand the economy, and one that is \r\nrewarded significantly by society in \r\nterms of its economic compensation \r\nand its status. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nThe teaching profession will become \r\nmore recognized and respected by \r\nthe general public as a critically \r\nl , \r\nessential and worthy profession. The \r\nimage of teachers, to themselves and \r\nto the public, will be considerably \r\nenhanced over what has historically\r\n\r\n\\ , \r\nbeen the case. \r\n\r\nperiod of time. Rather, these changes \r\nwill arise in single school districts, perhaps \r\neven, at first, only in individual schools. \r\nBut these kinds of goals should be our \r\nultimate aim as teachers and our primary \r\nobjective as a professional union. \r\n\r\nAlbert Fondy \r\nPaFT President \r\nMarch-April 1987 \r\n\r\nAF:as \r\nopeiu457 \r\nafl-cio \r\n\r\n********** \r\n\r\nThis article and the supplement \r\nto it were adapted and \r\nexpanded by PaFT President\' \r\nAlbert Fondy from a speech \r\nwhich he delivered on Saturday, \r\nOctober 25, 1986, to a symposium \r\non education held at Indiana \r\nUniversi ty of Pennsylvania. \r\n\r\n-11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nr ~ ~ ~..,\r\n\r\nr-.~--., \r\n\r\n~~ \r\n\r\n--\'--......;..l ~_--1\"_~ \'l....._~ __:L..:..:..J ~~ 1....._-,--1-----------\" \r\n\r\n8 BOSTON UNION TEACHER -JANUARY 1986\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _..-.-. ---..-. -.--.--.~.. \r\n\r\n.\" \r\n-.~ \r\n\r\nWalter Wood \r\n\r\nSchenley School Project Features Sabbaticals \r\n\r\nthemselves.

BRIEF HISTORY \r\nIn late 1981 Hammond school administrators began meetir.g \r\nwith educational consultants from the Kettering and Eli Lill:! \r\nFoundations to review a limited Secondary School Inprovement \r\nProject taking place in Indianapolis, Indiana. By spring of \r\n1982 the Kettering Foundation\'s IDEA program was funding \r\nfacilitator training programs for administrators, teachers, \r\ncommunity representatives, etc., in the Hammond School System. \r\nThe program at that time was limited to a pilot project in \r\nHammond High School. The high school project identified three \r\nareas in which they wished to make improvements: attendance, \r\ndrop-out reduction, and increased parental involvement. \r\nSignificant improvement was achieved in all three areas. \r\nAttendance was increased 3.3 percent. Membership in parental. \r\nprograms rose dramatically. In one year parent participation in \r\na ninth grade orientation meeting rose from a lowÂ· of seven \r\nparents to three hundred. The parent booster organization \r\ndoubled its membership. Academic failures were down by 382 artd \r\nby virtue of cause or coincidence, but certainly good fortune, \r\nfor the first time in years Hammond Higi\"\'. School had not one, but \r\nsix National Merit Scholarship winners. \r\n\r\n( \r\n\r\nDuring the 1984-85 school year the program was expanded to \r\nthree buildings with results warranting, in .the current school \r\nyear, district wide school building participation. \r\n\r\nThroughout the entire development the HFT, under the \r\nleadership of Patrick O\'Rourke, facilitated the implementation \r\nof this enormously sucessful program. \r\n\r\nVII. SUMMARY AND MAJOR PROGRAM FEATURES \r\n1.) The Hammond SIP Program represents a very successful \r\nand sophisticated level of whole school partnership. \r\n\r\n2.) The Hammond Federation of Teachers has devised a \r\nunique and adaptable method for balancing the potentially \r\nconflicting interests of building based work decisions against \r\nthe, need for a district wide strong collective bargaining \r\nagreement. I \r\n\r\n\r\nn \r\n\r\n\r\nn \r\n\r\n\r\n\\ d \r\n\r\ntJ \r\nP \r\n\r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nrJl j \r\n\r\nr 1\r\n\r\n! \\ \r\n\r\n[ ~ \r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\nr \r\n\r\n\r\nI \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\nt\' :>. \r\nI \r\n\r\nl J \r\nr \r\n\r\n\r\nl , \r\n\r\n\r\n3.) The SIP Program was very thoughtfully and gradually \r\nintroduced into the system over a three year period. \r\n\r\n4.) Throughout the entire period of the experiJ1lent data \r\nhas b.een collected and the program monitored to ascertai::: its \r\nsuccess and alter its design as necessary. \r\n\r\n5.) Demographics \r\n\r\nâ€¢ of students 15,000 \r\n\r\nt of buildings 30 school sites \r\n\r\nt of faculty 930 \r\n\r\n6.> Approximate three year costs for consultant fees, \r\nsubstitute teachers, meetings and travel: $90,000.00. \r\n\r\n\r\n7.) The HFT has cooperated in: the establishment of a. \r\npossible prototype of what the Carnegie Reports espouses as an \r\nideal school atmosphere for greater teacher autonomy and school \r\n\r\ndevelopment (pgs. 57-58 of report). .\r\n\r\n\" \r\n\r\n~.\' \r\n\r\n8.> In the bargaining scheduled for the 1986-87 school \r\nyear the union is considering modifying the system for changing \r\nbuilding-based-decisions to create a slightly less cumbersome \r\nprocedure. However, the current system is not really viewed as \r\nburdensome. \r\n\r\n9. ) \r\nBeginning with the 1986-87 school year a new \r\nbargaining unit position will be created to oversee the \r\nimplement\'ation of the educational related initiatives including \r\nSIP, Critical Thinking, ER& 0, Peer Evaluation and Mentoring. \r\nThe funding for this full time position will come from the local \r\ncity school system and a grant from the Teacher Quality \r\nCommittee of the State Department of Public Instruction. The \r\n$95,000.00 necessary for the progr~m will afford salary, travel \r\nand staff released time. \r\n\r\n10.) Dean Evans formerly of the Kettering Foundation and a \r\ncreative force in the initiation of this progran: is now the \r\nState Superintendant of Public Instruction. He was aFPointed to \r\ncomplete the term of an otherwise elected position. He enjoys \r\nbroad based support and respect. Additionally, he is very ~roud \r\nof the Hammond School System\'s cooperation and success. Hammond \r\nis very much the Indiana success story.\r\n\r\n, \r\n\r\nl J \r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE 7 \r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOpHE~ \r\n\r\n7.1 SCHOOL I..ROVEHElIT PROCESS (SIP)\' \r\nâ€¢â€¢ \r\nThe H-..on\' Te.cher.Â· Fe\'er.tion .n\' the lo.r\' en\'or.e the School \r\nI.prove.ent Proce...

PART I -- MERITORIOUS SCHOOLS Section 1. A. Implementation Agr eement\r\n\r\nThe Board and the Union agree to implement the Quality Instruction Incentives Program (QUIIP) for the 1984-85 school year only. Par  ticipation in the program shall be for the purpose of fur ther en hancing the perfor mance of students and of providing economic incen tives to eligible per sonnel. The program shall be free from racial or other pr ohibited discr imination. Three categor ies of schools shall be eligible to participate for 1984-85: elementar y schools, middle/junior high schools, and senior high schools. Each school, regar dless of socio-economic status or gr ade level, shall have an equal chance to be r ecognized as mer itor ious. The parties further agree that, since baseline data required by law do not exist for the distr ict1s regional vocational center s, adult schools, and other selected special school center s, a joint DCPS/UTD QU IIP Committee (as established in Section 7) shall discuss develop ment of a plan whereby these center s and schools may be eligible to par ticipate in subsequent years. Voluntary Participation\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nSection 2. A. B.\r\n\r\nPar ticipation in the program shall be completely voluntary. Par ticipation or non-par ticipation shall have no effect on the individ ual employee1s contr actual status; nor shall it be considered a factor in the assessment of an employee\'s perfor mance. There shall be no action taken by DCPS against any employee or school because of participation or non-par ticipation in the progr am.\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of voting on QU \\IP participation, eligible employees shall be defined as school-site employees who ar e member s of the UTD bar gaining unit and school-site administr ator s.\r\n--.:\r\n\r\nE.\r\n\r\nA school will par ticipate in the program only if approved by an affirmative vote of a 2/3 (two-thirds) major ity of eligible employees at the school, as defined in Section 2-D, in a sec;r et ballot election. Specific procedur es for conducting the election shall be mutually agr eed upon by DCPS and UTD and shall guar antee that all eligible school-site employees ar e given the oppor tunity to vote. Eligible itiner ant employees shall. vote at the school site to which they are assigned for payr oll purposes. No such vote shall be conducted pr ior to the district\'s receipt of a Cer tificate of Compliance, unless mutually agreed to by the parties. An eligible employee at a par ticipating school may elect, as an indi vidual, not to par ticipate. Such employee shall pr ovide notification of such intention within 10 calendar days of the school-site vote to participate I by completing a for m to be jointly developed by DCPS and UTD, and shall thereby waive the r ight to any and all awards as specified in Section 3. Said form shall be forwarded to the distr ict\'s Payroll Section. After the ten-day period has elapsed , the option to par ticipate in the program shall no longer - be available to eligible school-site employees who have non-par ticipation for ms on file.\r\n1.\r\n\r\nF.\r\n\r\nIn order to receive a share awar d as outlined in Section 3, an eligible full-time employee would have to be on the participating school\'s payr oll for at least eight of the ten school months during the 1984-85 school year. Eligible employees on the school\'s payroll less than that time would be eligible for a pro r ata shar e, as determined by the QU 1\\ P Committee. Persons not pr esent at the time the payment is made (due to tr ansfer within the distr ict, retirement, or appr oved leave) shall remain eligible for payment. All other issues related to eligibility, participation, and/or pay ment shall be deter mined by the QUIIP Committee. Recognition and Shar e Awards\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3. Section 3. A.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of this section, eligible employees at par ticipating schools shall be defined as including, but not Iimited to, all partic ipating school-site employees who are:\r\n1.\r\n\r\nMembers of the UTD bar gaining unit. Member s of the UOPD/UTD bar gaining unit. Administr ator s. Full-time maintenance, custodial, and cafeteria per sonnel.

APPENDIX III\r\n\r\nPROPOSED STATISTICAL PROCED URES FOR SELECTING LEVEL ONE AND LEVEL TWO MERITORIOUS SCHOOLS The procedures described here are. those to be used in identifying the .Step 1 (0) and Step 2 (E) schools in the 1984-85 D CPS/UTD Ouality Jnstruction Incentives Program (OUIIP). The functions of the first step include: (1) identifying those approxi mately 42 elementary, 12 middle/junior high, and six senior high schools which are in the uppermost quartile on the residual (actual-minus expected) 1985 Stanford Achievement Test results; (2) conducting further screening of these 60 schools to determine if at least 80% of their eligible. students participated in a standardized physical fitness test during the school year; and (3) conducting such secondary analyses as are necessary to insure that results for the schools are unbiased and are free of socio-economic and grade-level influences. Schools meeting the criteria established in this first step will be designated The functions of the second screening step are to identify those approximately 21 elementary, six middle/junior high, and three senior high 11 011 schools with the most positive improvement on a third variable. For elementary and middle/junior high schools, the criterion variable is attendance rate improvement. For senior high schools, the variable is a composite of dropout rate reduction and attendance rate\' improvement. (For middle/junior and senior high schools, improvement in subject area test results, from diverse academic areas and for which base line district data exist, may be substituted for the attendance and/or dropout criteria. ) As was the case in the initial screening, secondary analyses will be conducted to insure lack of bias and freedom from socio-economic and grade configuration influences. The approximately 30 schools meeting the above criteria will be designated \"Ell schools.\r\n\r\n\"0\" schools.\r\n\r\nk;.\r\n\r\nThe two steps discussed above will be conducted by the three-person . Technical Review Panel, supported by OEA staff and equipment. To more explicitly identify the variables and statistical procedures to be used in the secondary analyses referenced above, a series of trial analyses will be conducted during 1984-85, using 1982-83 and 1983-84 data. The Technical Review Panel is responsible for resolving all methodological (statistical and measurement) issues identified in these trial analyses. The focus of the resolution will be to remove the influence of factors which affect the criterion variables, e. g. , Stanford test results, over which the schools have little or no control and to specifically remove the influence of socio-economic and grade configu ration factors. In those cases where the Technical Review Panel has doubt about the status of a factor, for example, a generic and positive effect due to the State Compensatory Education Program, the decision will be referred to. the QU II P Committee for resolution. At the end of Step 2, identification of the \"EII schools, the Technical Review Panel will have completed its respon sibilities.\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nAn outline of the procedures for calculating the Stanford residual means (in Step 1) is now presented. The residual school means will be developed along the lines of the Similarity Indices used by the Testing Department from 1972 through 1981 ,t.9 analyze Stanford school means. The process compares the achievement pf each individual student to the average achievement of the group of all similar students throughout the district. This \"similar group\" for each student will be defined according to factors k nown from earlier research to be uniquely associated with student achievement gains but over which the schools have Iittle or no control. Among these factors are the student\'s test score from the previous year, sex, ethnic membership, and grade. Consider as an example the case\' of an individual student with a 1984\' Stanford percentile score in reading comprehension of say 56, and whose previous (1983) score was also 56. * In order to k now whether this \' represents an improvement on the student\'s part, more must be k nown about the student. Suppose the student. is a black female in the fourth grade. The simi lar group for this student consists of all black female students in the district who are currently in the fourth grade, and who scored in the 56 percentile on the Stanford reading comprehension in 1983. Suppose further that the average score for this group for 1984 is 52. This is the score expected of every member of that group, the original Since the student\'s score was 56 in 1984, she scored student included. four points above what she was \"expected\" to score, and this +4 is her residual score. Whenever a student\'s actual score is higher than the similar group\'s average, that student\'s residual score will be positive; if the actual score is lower, the residual will be negative. The school\'s actual-minus-expected is the average residual score of all students in the school; it represents the extent to which all students in the school score above (or below) their similar cohorts in oth er schools throughout the district. It is in this sense that the schaal\'s residual mean represents lithe degree to which actual aggregate student scores on the standardized achievement tests (Stanford) exceed predicted scores\" (Act, p. 6 line 31 - p. 7, lines 1-3) . Earlier research has shown that residual means computed as described above were generally free of socia-economic influences; that is, schools drawing from high socio-economic (SES) census tracts (1970) were no more likely to have positive re sidual means than schools drawing from low SES tracts. Freedom from SES influence is, of course, a requirement of the Act (p. 7, lines 6-8) .\r\nâˆ‘ . âˆ‘\r\n\r\nf!-\r\n\r\n*Because of their familiarity, percentile scores are used in the example. For technical reasons, scale scores will be used in the analyses.\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nThe practice in previous years had been to compute the residual means separately for each subtest and grade. The Act, however, requires use of a school mean. To arrive at the school mean, the _:grade-Ievel (Stanford) residual means will be standardized and then averaged to I?roduce a single residual mean for each school. This mean will represent .the comparative performance of all students in the school who have two consecutive years of Stanford scores.\r\nA\r\n\r\nsecond series of regression-based, school-level analyses will be conducted to determine if there are school characteristics (such as those contained in the D istrict and School Profiles) , which are uniquely asso ciated with the school\'s residual means. These factors will include such characteristics as school size, percent of students receiving free or\' reduced price lunches, and number of library books. If it is found, for example, that students with access to more library book s consistently achieve higher Stanford scores, then schools with larger libraries may enjoy an unfair advantage. A list of such relationships, if any are found, will be compiled and reviewed by the Technical Review Panel. As earlier noted, if the Technical Review Panel is in doubt regarding the status of these relationships, the issues wi (I be referred to the QUI IP Committee for resolution.\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n... \"--.\r\nRATIFICATION/PARTICIPATION DCPS/UTD QUALITY INSTRUCTION INCENTIVES PROGRAM\r\n\r\n____ âˆ‘âˆ‘ _______Lâˆ‘âˆ‘\r\n\r\nRATI FI CATIONI PA RTIC 1PATION NOTIFICATION\r\n\r\nWHO VOTES I PARTICIPATES\r\n\r\nREQUI REMENTS\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\n\r\nContract Ratification: - Pursuant to F.S. , Ch. 447.309, - Pursuant to F.

The following information specifies the legal requirements and the corresponding UTD/DCPS Program Components:\r\n1\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nThe State Law The program must be negotiated and ratified by the bargaining agent (teacher union) and School Board with final Department of Education approval of the plan. UTD/DCPS QUIIP PROGRAM The plan has been negotiated, with tentative agreement reached on September 8, 1984. Ratification is scheduled for the lath, 19th or 20th for UTD bargaining unit members and the 19th for the school board.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe State Law All schools can participate and be eligible to win. UTD/DCPS QUIIP PROGRAM All elementary, middle/junior high, and senior highs areâˆ‘ eligible. (Vocational, adult centers, and special schools are not eligible in 1984-85 because of the absence of baseline data).\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThe State Law Participation must be voluntary. UTD/DCPS QUIIP PROGRAM To pClrticipate, each school must vote by a 2/3 majority in favor of participation in the program, with UTD bargaining unit meMbers and administrators eligible to vote. However, individual teachers may still decide not to participate. There is contract protection for schools and teachers who do not participate.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThe State Law Only .25% of participating schools are eligible for monetary awards, with the awards based, in part, on student gains in the upper quartile on a standardized test in verbal and quantitative achievement. UTD/DCPS QUIIP PROGRAM In Dade, that means a possible. total of 60 schools will be eligible for monetary awards. These schools will be designated, according to achievement, as Quality (Q), Excellent (E) or Educational Excellence (E 1) schools. The criteria are as follows: Q Schools -- determined by relative gain in student achievement on the Stanford Achievement Test, and by attaining at least 80 percent partiCipation of eligible students on a standardized physical fitness test. E Schools -- selected from the Q Schools and based on improvement in In addition, at the senior high school level, student attendance. Improvement in reducing the dropout rate.\r\nEl Schools -- chosen from the E Schools, based on development and achievement of a plan to improve student performance.. Each partici pating school in the district -- every school aspiring to the eventual El status -!.. will have the facu , ty and school administration working as a team to develop and implement a plan of its own choosing, a plan designed to correct and/or improve some aspect of student achieve ment. (OVER)\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nThe State Law Shares will be distributed as follows: Full-time Cfrtificated Personnel including School-Site Administrators Full-Time Teacher Aidesl Assistants Full Share One-Half Share One-Third Share-:\"\r\n\r\n($1,500.00)\r\nOne-Half Share\r\n\r\n($ 750.00) ($ 375.00)\r\n\r\n($ 500.00)\r\n\r\n($ 750.00)\r\n\r\nOne-Quarter Share\r\n\r\nOne-Sixth Share\r\n\r\n($ 250.00) ($ 125.00)\r\n\r\nFull-time Secretarial Clerical Personnel\r\n\r\nOne-Quarter Share\r\n\r\n($ 375.00) ;. 15 Share t$ 225.00)\r\n\r\nOne-Eighth Share\r\n\r\n($ 187.50)\r\n\r\nOne-Twelfth Share\r\n\r\nOther Full-time Personnel\r\n\r\n. 075 Share ($112.50)\r\n\r\n.05 Share ($ 75.00)\r\n\r\nUTD/DCPS QUIIP PROGRAM\r\nSchool-site administrators and other support personnel could also be eligible for monetary awards. 6.\r\n\r\nThe State Law Schools participating In the statistically predicted gain. plan compare their gains against a\r\n\r\nUTD/DCPS QUIIP PROGRAM\r\nEach participating school\'s standardi.zed test scores are comparect, initially, to Its own scores from the previous year. This assures that every participating school has an equal chance to reach the upper quartile. These results are then measured against other schools at the same grade level groupings (I.e., elementary, middlel junior and senior high) to determine the Q schools. 7.\r\n\r\nThe State Law\r\n\r\nAt least 50% of the state dollars (Dade\'s estimated share is $3 million) must be used for a meritorious school program. UTD/DCPS QUIIP PROGRAM\r\nVirtually 100% of Dade\'s initial allocation has been earmarked for this program. This was done to guarantee the amount of payments stipulated in \'5 above.\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nThe State Law The remainder of the funds could be used for other incentives awards such as attendance, tuition reimbursement, supplements for the extended day program In science, âˆ‘âˆ‘math and computer education, critical teacher shortage or high priority location supplements. UTD/DCPS QU IIP PROGRAM If Dade\'s allocation from the state Increases as a result of other school districts not particioating, increased incentive awards will be funded.\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n.\' ...\r\n\r\n@\r\n1.\r\n\r\nQu a lit y Instruction Incentl\"es Program (QUIIPJ\r\nSOME QUESTIONS MID ANSIIUS ABOUT\r\n\r\nÃŸj\r\n\r\ngullP\r\n\r\nO.\r\n\r\nDO I tMVE TO PARTICIPATE!\r\nA.\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\'.rtlclp.tlon in\r\n\r\ntho OuIllty Inltruction IncentIves PrOlr..

Some ofâˆ‘the fundamental requirements in the law are as follow: o The program must be negotiated and ratified by both the teachers\' bargaining unit and the local school board. o All participating schools, regardless of socio-economic differences and grade levels, must have an equal chance to be recognized as meri torious schools. o Procedures for selection of meritorious schools must non- biased. be fair and\r\n\r\no School and individual participation in the program must be voluntary. o A standard or standards, in addition to achievement of gains in the upper quartile on a standardized test in verbal and quantitive student achievement, must be included in the plan.\r\no\r\n\r\nParticipating schools must compare actual gains against a statistically predicted gain for their students. Non-instructional personnel and school-site administrators may partic ipate in the meritorious school program.\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\n;\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, September 8, 1984 the Dade County Public Schools (DC PS) and the United Teacher.s of Dade (UTD) reached tentative agreement at the collective bargaining table on an amendment to the current DCPS/UTD labor contract establishing a Meritorious Schools Program. Ratification of this agreement by the School Board has been scheduled for September 19, , 98 and for the UTD bargaining unit on September 18-20, 1984. Upon ratification, the plan must be submitted to the Florida Department of Education for approval. This must occur no later than October 1, 1984.\r\n\r\nSeptember 13, Page 2\r\n\r\nQUALITY INSTRUCTION INCENTIVES PROGRAM (MERITORIOUS SCHOOLS)\r\n1984\r\n\r\nThe negot iated contraCt amendment authorizes up to a part icipat ing schools to become el igible for share awards. w ill be d istr ibuted pursuant to the follow ing criter ia:\r\n\r\ntotal of 60 Such awards\r\n\r\nQu al ity (Q) Schools: o Ach ieving the upper quartile \'of part ic ipat ing d istrict schools at com\r\nparable grade level groups\' ( i.e., elementary, m iddle/junior high, s enior h igh) as measured by student gain in verbal and q uant itat ive achievement on the 1985 ad minis tr ation of the S tanford Achievement\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nTest; and,\r\n\r\no Achieving\r\n\r\nat least an 80% participation of eligible students or maintaining the 1983-84 rate, whichever is gr eate r , on a standardized physical fitness test during the 1984-85 school ye ar .\r\n\r\nExce\"ent (E) Schools: Selection shall be based on attainment, year, of the following district goal: by the end of t he 1 984-85 school\r\n\r\no Elementary School level -, 983-84 for the plan year.\r\no\r\n\r\nImprovement in s tud ent attendance over\r\n\r\nMiddle/Junior High School level -- Improvement in student attendance over 1983-84; or improvement in subject area tests, when appropriate tests in multiple and diverse academic subject areas are available and baseline district data are established.\r\n\r\no Senior High School level -- Improvement in student attendance and dropout ra te over 1983-84; or improvement in s ubj e ct area tests,\r\n\r\nwhen appropriate tests in multiple and diverse academic subject areas are avail able and baseline district data a re es tab lis hed .\r\n\r\nEducational Excellence (E2) Schools:\r\n\r\no Selection shall be based on attainment of a school student achievement\r\nstandard select ed by each faculty, which shall consist of school-site c ert if i cated personnel.

However, shares may increase subject to additional state allocations to the district. Such awa rds wi II be made by October 1, 1985.\r\nthree ad hoc committees will be established:\r\no\r\n\r\n\'\r\n\r\nfn order to facilitate implementation of the Meritorious Schools Program,\r\nQuality Ins tructio n Incentives Prog ram (QU II P) Committee - Will serve to insure the orderly and equitable implementation of this program and shall receive and adjudicate any appeals related to its implementation.\r\nc\r\n\r\nTechnical Review Panel Will r e v i e w all of the data, methodology, and statistical information in order to make technical recommendations to the QUIIP Committee.\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\nEducational Excellence Awards Committee - Shall have the responsibility for reviewing all data, consistent with applicable state statutes, and making the selection of Q, E, and E2 schools.

Yet evaluation, increasingly the focus of reform efforts throughout the country, has traditionally been charactertized, if present at all in school systems, as lacking reliabilit (the consIstency of measures across evaluators and observations , validity (the accuracy-comprehensiveness in assessing the quality by defined criteria) and effectiveness. Over one-half of U.S. school districts do not have teacher evaluation systems. While recognizing the value of sound, fair and objective evaluation, teachers generally report that they do not know the criteria for evaluation, that they are rarely observed, and that evaluation feedback is scarceâˆ‘ (Darling-Hammond, et aI, 1984).\r\n\r\nr\r\n\r\n\\\r\n\r\nStudies verify that teachers would prefer fair and equitable evaluations on a regular basis which provide specific feedback on their work, recogmze. their strengths and indicate with concrete examples how they might improve._ Yet the state of the art is fairly primitive. The problems associated with teacher evaluation, as found in the Rand study, include the fact that school authorities \"do not agree on what constitutes best practice with regard to instrumentation, frequency of evaluation, the role of the teacher in the process, or how the information could or should inform other district activities.\" Other major problems found include the lack of uniformity and consistency of evaluation within a school system and inadequate training for evaluators.\r\nWHAT WE KNOW\r\n\r\nTeacher evaluation processes have increasingly become the subject of collective bargaining agreements. Darling-Hammond, et. aI., note that between 1970-75, the percentage of contracts that contained teacher evaluation provisions increased from 42 to 65 percent. This figure should increase as state and local school systems attempt such reforms as career ladders which are predicateq_âˆ‘ on a sound evaluation system in career advancement and salary decisions, and as new approaches to teacher evaluation, such as peer assistance and review are initiated. Unfortunately research has not identified a teacher evaluation method which is unvaryingly successful. The @:and \\report cites the generally low levels of reliability, generalizability and validity-and suggests that unidimentpnal  approaches for assessin com etence erformance or effectiveness are unlik y .to cap ure enough information aQ.Qut teaching at1ribute to completely satisfy any of\' tl1e purposes of teacher evaluation. Evaluation serves a dual role-it can be formative (for the improvement and encouragement of teacher performance) or it can be summative (to be used for personnel decisions and accountability). Different requirements are necessary for each. The former requires specific detail of individual strength and weakness, with highly specific recommendations for the teacher to follow. The latter,\r\n\r\nespecially relative to demotion or dismissal decisions, requires standardized and objective criteria for defensible decision-making. To be defensible, such procedures have to be clearly articulated, fair, reasonable, valid and reliable. Because of the complexity of the teacbinLQrocesÃŸ.Jlnd the difficult in boilin the rocess down into a set of discrete and measurable skills highly prescriptive evaluation requirements are lOa equate. The Rand report notes that \"the teaching performances advanced as having consistently positive effects on student achievement are relatively broad constructs rather than discreteJ. specific actions of teachers.\" It finds little evidence that single teaching performance variables can be essential for effective teaching, but that differences in patterns contribute to learning. They note that effective teaching behaviors \"vary for students Q.L different socio-economic. mental an9: psychological characteristics and for different grade levels and subject areas and that the more complex and variable the educational environment is seen. as being, the more one must rely on teacher judgment or even insi ht to uide t e ac IVI les 0 c assroom I e, an e ess one relies on generalized rules for teacher behavior.\" It is becoming commonly accepted that sin Ie measures \'*   of teacher performance are inad.eg to pmvide a comp ete PIC ure 0 competence and effectiveness.\r\nAPPROACHES\r\n\r\nSo what has been found to be effective? The Rand study of effective teacher evaluation practices has made a significant contribution to our knowledge in this area. The authors surveyed the evaluation practices of 32 school districts and selected 4 case study districts representing diverse teacher evaluation processes and organizational environments: Salt Lake City, Utah; Lake Washington, Washington; Greenwich, Connecticut; and AFT local, Toledo, Ohio. (The Toledo Plan, the only plan of its kind, involves experienced teachers in a form of peer review system for teacher interns and for teachers who require assistance in their classrooms.) While district approaches varied with respect to who evaluates and who is evaluated, the major purposes of evaluation, the instruments used, the processes by which judgments are made and the link with other organizational activities, there were certain common practices which set these systems apart from the less successful ones:\r\n1. 2. 3.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nOrganizational commitment. Evaluator comeetence . Teacher-admimstrator collaboration.. Strategic compatibility\r\n\r\nMAJOR ISSUES\r\n\r\nA key obstacle to successful evaluation is lack of time: time to observe and confer with teachers, time for providing feedback and assisting teachers who need help. Organizational commitment includes the allocation of the time and the necessary resources. In the most successful districts, the teachers\' dministra\' in the design and umon co ra e Wlt the - school lmp ementation of the teac er evaluation process. r\r\n_\r\n\r\nSchool districts have to ensure the reliability and validity of their process. The personnel decisions need to be the most reliable since issues of tenure and\r\n\r\ndismissal- involve one\'s basic rights. Thus, the evaluation criteria must be standardized and consistently applied by the evaluators in these summative decisions. Unreliability may occur in the variability of a single evaluator\'s inconsistent use of criteria, or a group of evaluators operating under different criteria. Wise, et a1 also note that the criteria, the process for collecting data, and the competence of the evaluator contrIbute to the validity of the process. The crIterIa for Judging minimal competence must be standardized, generalizable and uniformly applied but finer distinctions among good, better and outstanding teachers require nonstandardized, differential criteria. Successful evaluation builds in due process and other protections for the teacher. Procedural due process is a guarantee of the 14th Amendment concerning life, liberty or property. Careful documentation of unsatisfactory teaching is necessary to ensure a valid and fair process. The more effective systems require multiple observations and opportunity (and support) for the teacher. Teacher involvement in the evaluation design and development is crucial. The system can either reinforce the idea of teaching as a profession or it can further deprofessionalize it. Teachers have to be treated like professionals if they are expected to be professionals. A vision of the teacher as professional\' creates new frontiers for the profession. This new vision calls for vital new. alternatives and opportunities for the teaching role. Concepts such as peer review and assistance and self evaluation are just some of the ways that the evaluation process can be made more meaningful for practitioners. This vision involves input, involvement and decision-making responsibility for teachers particularly in relation to decisions directly affecting them. That the Rand study found teacher and teacher organization involvement as characterizing more effective teacher evaluation rams is a significant finding.\r\nAFT POSITION/ACTION GUIDELINES\r\n\r\n__\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nThe AFT continues its stand for fair and objective evaluation procedures for teachers. Effective evaluation should be part of an overall commitment to improving school effectiveness and enhancing. professional skills as well as a mechanism for identifying teachers experiencing difficulty.

Knowledge in St. Louis\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nProfessionalism Under W\r\n\r\nFire\r\n\r\nhat should be the response of educators when one of their number . does something that is foolish, unprofessional or outrageous? School superintendents have great power under state law, but they have this power not just because someone hasâˆ‘ to beâˆ‘ in charge but because they are supposed to know more about what works in education and how to manage and organize schools in accordance with an accepted knowledge base. In St. Louis, Superintendent Jerome B. Jones last year announced that teachers in the district would be rated unsatisfactory and lose their jobs unless their students reached specific levels of achievement or im provement on standardized achievement tests. According to the experts, these tests cannot be used to measure whether teachers are competent orâˆ‘not or whether they should be retained or dismissed. The issues involved are technical, but they can be compared to what, happens in other professions. If a large percentage of patients do not, improve after visting a given doctor, or even take a turn for the worse, what does this tell us about the quality of the doctor? Not much. Before we could answer that question we would need a good deal of additional information. Did the patient suffer from a disease that a doctor could do something about or was the disease, incurable? What course of action did the doctor prescribe? Was it the same that most others would pre scribe on the basis of medical knowledge? Or was it unorthodox? Did the patient purchase and take the medicine? Did he rest, stop smoking and . follow the special diet?\r\n\r\nNo one would want to deprive a doctor of the right o practice merly because his patients did not fae well. W.e would shll hae to answer the question: Was it the doctor s fault? Did he do 7verythmg a good doctor could be expected to do even though the patIent was ot cured? Similarly in law, there are cases whre !he l!lwyer on the losmg side did a better job than the lawyer on the wmmng Side. Should. a lawyer who loses a certain nur.lber in a row or a given percentage be dIsbarred? Suh a proposal, if it were acted on WOUld b.e vied as folish , un . professional or outrageous. In law, as m r;nedlcme, It IS poslble for a professional to do everything that can pOSSibly be done and still lose the case for reasons beyond his control. . In St. Louis, Superintendent Jones Just looks at the test scores of the . students in a teacher\'s class. Either the numbers are good or out With the teacher. No one bothers to ask if the teacher did everything possible to help the students. Did the stuents fail in spi. te of wat the teacher did because they didn\'t pay attentIOn or do outSide readmg or homework? Or did a particular teacher just happen to get a group of students who always scored poorly and made very little progress no matter who the teacher or what the educational program was? And what about the home life of the students? Do they have the right kind of supervision by their . parts or the appropriate environment for stud nd homework? Unlike most leaders in the field of law and medlcme, Mr. Jones IS not only a professional educator, but, since he has to be elected by the school board to the superintendency, he is also a politician. He will undoubted ly get some cheers and votes for playing to. the gran.dsta!ld. with !Iis \"Off with their heads!\" approach and for pushmg the simphstic notIOn that only results count, \' . .

Campbell\r\n\r\n>-\"---\'-I-cCOrding to a recent survey,*\r\n\r\n, principals say that the single most important aspect of their job is teacher evaluation. That being so, it is not surprising that a large body of knowledge has been accumulated regarding teacher ap praisal. However, differences con tinue to exist among leading au thorities as to various possible strategies and approaches. What fol lows is an attempt to synthesize and highlight the major tenents of the evaluative process, with an emphasis on the most practical aspects.\r\n\r\nAn appraisal of strengths and weaknesses. Feedback in this area\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nwould likely concentrate on such areas as (1) classroom management and organization, (2) instructional strategies, (3) presentation of subject matter, and (4) learning environment, with each of these domains being considered in appropriate breadth and depth.\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nEstablishment onr:>alT6llJ\'J. communication between principal and the teacher. There should be a\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nJust about everyone agrees that the primary purposes for evaluating teacher performance continue to be to seek to improve instruction and to establish a basis for personnel deci sions. The latter, in the harshest as pects becomes a question of reten tion or dismissal, and for purposes of defense against possible litigation, it is imperative that the teacher be so informed. Within the primary purposes of teacher evaluation, the evaluation should at a minimum provide\' the following:\r\n\r\nAn Overview\r\n\r\nverbal and nonverbal communication from the principal should convey constructive remarks intended to be informational, directional, and motivational. Any hope for improved performance hinges upon how con structively the principal is able to de liver the message and how positively it is received by the teacher.\r\n\r\nCommunication that encour ages improved performance. Both\r\n\r\nA basis for administrative deci sions. In time, every principal is called\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nfree exchange of ideas between the principal and the teacher, with the appraisal conference serving as one means of validating that the principal is a straightforward, available, ac ceptant, and caring person. To create such a perception is to enhance teacher morale and to assure a posi tive evaluation experience.\r\n\r\nIdentification of inservice train ing, staff development, and other pro fessional growth activities needed to overcome identified deficiences. Far\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nupon to make decisions regarding re tention and dismissal. So critical a decision regarding a person\'s profes sional career deserves careful, delib erate consideration and is a subject addressed at length in many books, monographs, and professional journals.\r\n\r\ntoo often in evaluative sessions, prin cipals may identify deficiencies in one skill or another but suggest no specific remediation or other assis tance. For improved job performance to occur, the principal must be able to point to specific, available help, and then leave no stone unturned in see ing to it that the teacher actually re ceives this help.\r\n\r\nFour rather distinct steps are a part of the teacher performance eval uation cycle. Each plays a vital role, and none may be skipped over lightly. They are: 1. Establishing the rules. It is ab solutely essential that the building principal carefully plan all the details\r\nLloyd P. Campbell is a professor in North Texas State University\'s graduate school of education.\r\n\r\nThe Evaluation Cycle\r\n\r\nâˆ‘See \"What Makes a Principal Tick?\" by Jim Sweeney and Bob Vittengl in Principal, January 1987.\r\n\r\ni\r\n\r\n:\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\nNtional\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nAssociation\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nElementary\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nSchool\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nPrincipals\r\n\r\nthat will be involved in evaluating each individual teacher. As with a well-designed lesson plan, the princi pal must clearly address the objec tives to be achieved, the activities that will assure the accomplishment of those objectives, the materials needed to complement and enhance the activities, and a method or proce dure by which the teacher evaluation process itself can be evaluated. Establishing the rules for teacher evaluation includes determining who will do the classroom evaluation (principal, assistant principal, etc.), the purpose of the classroom visits, the number of classroom visits to be expected, whether visits are planned, unannounced, or on invitation, and whether there will be a follow-up con -ference or only written feedback. In some districts, many of these deci sions have been taken out of the principal\'s hands by state-mandated legislation. A case in point is the state of Texas, where legislation clearly spells out who is to evaluate, the number of formal classroom visits to be made, the nature of the conferenc ing process, etc. In other places, local districts have established guidelines to which the principal is expected to adhere. It is of course essential that the principal become thoroughly in formed about such limitations-state and local-and the procedures and standards they call for.\r\n\r\nexample, on a grade level basis. The basic concept is to reduce the number of participants to a point that permits an open, free discussion, thus assuring that every teacher has the opportunity for two-way communica tion with the building principal before the evaluative process begins. Undergirding the verbal orienta-\r\n\r\nWrite things down: It is important to have a full record of what was said.\r\ntion process should be written com munication. While verbal orientation is both necessary and desirable, the spoken word is often quickly forgot ten. It is thus important to have hand outs that highlight the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the overall evaluation process as con ducted at that school. In addition, in the unhappy event that litigation were to occur, written documents are far better evidence than one\'s recollec tion of what was allegedly explained.\r\n\r\n2. Orienting the teacher. The es sence of all effective human relations is clear communication, and clear communication is nowhere more im portant in teacher-principal relation ships than in orienting teachers to the mechanics of the process of teacher evaluation. A typical approach is to do so in a general faculty meeting at the beginning of the academic year. If an inordinately large faculty is involved, with the possibility that the message will get lost or be diluted, many prin cipals have found it more desirable and effective to meet with smaller groups-to set up sessions, for\r\n\r\n3. Formative evaluation (data gathering). The third step in the\r\n\r\nteacher performance evaluation cycle is the actual classroom visitation. A number of crucial questions must be answered in the planning stage, long before the principal steps into the classroom for the first formal visit. Even if the number of classroom visi tations has been mandated by legisla tion or district policy, the wise princi pal recognizes the importance of building in some flexibility. It is far bet ter to inform the general faculty that\r\n\r\nthere will be one to three formal visits per faculty member and then find that time constraints prevent such an ob jective from being accomplished. In actuality, teachers are much like their own students; that is, some need more attention and instruction than others. Therefore, the astute principal will maximize his visits to those need ing the most help, and minimize his visits to the strongest teachers. In any case, it is most important to under stand that every teacher (including the most outstanding) should be, and deserves to be, visited and formally evaluated at least once a year. Even positive value judgments about a teacher\'s instruction made by a prin cipal who did not feel it necessary to visit is still likely to elicit a response such as, \"How does he know? He didn\'t see me teach.\" Negative at titudes often develop when teachers receive the idea that they are not worthy of even a single classroom visit during the school year. Teacher morale is at stake throughout the en tire evaluation process and should be continuously addressed. A second part of the data gather. ing is to determine the exact purpose for visiting the classroom, thereby de termining the length of time neces sary to be in the classroom. For example, informal observation or a previous visit may have established that a particular teacher\'s problems occur at the beginning of the class period. The teacher has had difficulty in getting students on task and the principal wants to observe whether the teacher has made any progress in solving this problem. In another case a teacher had difficulty in bringing off closure and then a smooth transition to new ideas, concepts, or materials. In still a third case, a teacher seems unable to bring the class period to a clear, definite end. Drop-in visitations to these three teachers obviously should be made at different parts of the class period. In short, the purpose for being in the classroom largely dic tates the time to arrive and the\r\n\r\nâ€¢ ;;\r\n,\r\n\r\nii\'\r\n\r\n,\" ,\r\n\r\nh,\r\n\r\namount of time to be spent there. . A third factor in classroom visita tions is knowing what to observe. It is essential that principals have with them a checklist that reflects items that are relevant to the evaluation of the particular teacher involved. A basic list might well include classroom management and organization, in structional strategies, presentation of subject matter, and the learning envi ronment that has been created. It is further necessary that notes be taken and recorded during the ob servation phase at exactly that mo ment. Principals who have attempted to. \"remember\" what they saw and heard and \"write the evaluation when they get back to the office\" have jeopardized both reliability and va lidity. Realistically, the chances of principals going directly to their office to record their observations are poor, given the multitude of interruptions that mark a typical day. A final important part of the formal classroom visitation process for the principal is to determine if such visits should be planned in advance with the teacher or unannounced. While there may be some dissenters, au thorities in teacher evaluation en dorse both kinds of visits, particularly for probationary teachers. One school of thought regarding the planned visit is what one would expect-principals should see teachers at their best. Ob viously, most teachers can be ex pected to try to put their best foot for ward in such instances. And it makes infinite sense to most principals that they see the very best teaching the teacher is capable of offering. The planned visit should insure that. On the other hand, since planned visits could result in a contrived, artifi cial classroom performance, other au thorities feel the unannounced visit would provide the prinCipal a more valid experience--:-an insight into a more typical, everyday classroom per formance. And still other authorities suggest both scheduled and unan nounced formal visits.\r\n\" .âˆ‘\r\n\r\nstates where legislation mandates matters that are to be considered in evaluating teachers, the feedback from classroom visitations is some times delivered in a form to be com pleted by the principal. Forms can be useful, but normally they are not\r\n\r\n4. Summative evaluation (judgmental in nature). Particularly in\r\n\r\nIn giving feedback, the spoken word has far more impact then the written word.\r\nenough; they lack impact. A far more impressive means of communicating feedback is the principal/teacher con ference. In this kind of professional re lationship, the spoken word has far greater force than the written word, and in any case a conference provides the opportunity for construc tive give and take and for the principal to make sure that the teacher is not confused or has questions. The goal of the session should be both to give information and get in formation, as one means of building a cooperative attitude on the part of the teacher. Note that while the principal may have the most information to im part, it is important that the teacher be given ample opportunity to convey facts and express opinions. There may be significant variables that in fluenced the teacher\'s performance during the visitation-matters of which the principal may have been completely unaware: some personal problems, perhaps, or possibly some especially difficult students in this par ticular class.\r\n\r\nThe principal should be sure that the conference takes place as soon as possible after the classroom visit, preferably within 72 hours. Teachers are often anxious about such confer ences, and besides alleviating anxi ety, a prompt follow-up assures that the recall level of both participants has not begun to fade. Additionally, it is essential that the counseling session be private and free of interruptions. Nothing can cast a pall over the conference more quickly than for the principal to inter rupt the session to accept telephone calls or take time out to confer with someone or give instructions to the secretary. Such interruptions convey a message that the principal feels that the conference, and the teacher, are not really important. The more carefully the confer ence/counseling session has been planned, the more effective it is likely to be. Presumably the plan will cover such matters as the following: 1. Basic information, including the teacher\'s name and the class being observed, plus relevant personal data about the teacher (background, years taught, etc.). 2. Objectives, including particular skills and strategies to be alert to. 3. Timing, including making sure the teacher has been notified, and de termining what written materials or in formation the principal or the teacher should bring to the conference. 4. Opening the conference: Put ting the teacher at ease, summarizing the nature and purposes of the con ference, noting any questions that need to be cleared up before the con ference swings into gear. 5. Action: Give and take between teacher and principal on the latter\'s observations; suggestions by the principal; agreement on procedures or techniques by which the teacher will seek to improve performance. 6. Closing: Summary of what has been discussed; reiteration of next steps.\r\n\r\nSuch planning not only ensures that the conference will stay on track\r\n\r\n,11IIt\' ;j\r\nand respond to the teacher\'s needs, but also gives the principal confi dence and assurance by providing the session with a clear structure and purpose. A synthesis of the findings of re search on conducing teacher evalu ations and conferences would sug gest the following ten commandments: 1. Plan for the counseling session. 2. Conduct the session in a quiet, private place. 3. Make use of all pertinent facts. 4. Usten to the teacher. 5. Remain calm regardless of the teacher\'s attitude. 6. Fit all comments and sug gestions to the specific needs of this particular teacher. Focus on actions-do not appear\r\n\r\nto be attacking the teacher personally. 8. Offer encouragement. 9. Leave the teacher anxious to improve. 10. Plan for any needed follow-up interviews. Summing up, evaluating teacher performance remains one of the most difficult tasks that building principals encounter. Drawing upon the major theory and research in vogue today, it is first of all clear that the evaluation cycle has four cornerstones-estab lishing roles, orienting the teacher, making a formative evaluation, and offering a summative evaluation. Each is critically important. Indeed, the goals of teacher evaluation-to improve teaching effectiveness and make personal decisions-are de pendent on those four variables. A fifth and final variable that needs to be understood by all principals is that teacher response to an evaluation of their instruction will be directly related to their perceived relationship with the person conducting the observation e.g., the principal. In short, the princi pal\'s professional and personal rap port with the teacher will be of crucial importance in influencing the teacher toward behavioral changes necessary\r\n\r\nto improve instruction. Teachers are not likely to respond favorably to sug gestions for change that emanate from someone they do not respect. Such teacher reactions and at titudes demonstrate how clearly profi ciency in human relations relates to being a proficient principal. In fact, teacher evaluation represents one of the most rigid tests of a principal\'s ability to relate to others. As research has long since demonstrated, effec tive schools come about through the leadership of effective principals leadership based on the establish ment of a positive relationship with the school\'s staff. In no aspect of the principal\'s job is a positive relation ship important than in teacher evaluation.\r\n\r\nStreamlined Seminar is issued as a service\r\nto members.

Questions of education quality, consequently, are on the agenda of most state legislatures and local school boards2 and the debate about \"solutions\" is heated. Teacher evaluation, this article argues, can be\r\na\r\n\r\npowerful strategy for achieving these school\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nimprovement goals. Practitioners may find this position surprising if riot wrong-headed. Many doubt that teacher evaluation can serve both accountability objectives and improvement concerns. Indeed, many practitioners have divorced improve ment and assessment purposes in teacher evaluation so that staff-development activities will not be seen as punitive. But it is also true that few districts have actively pursued links between teacher evaluation and improvement. Most educators see current teacher evaluation practice as a waste of time and resources. In a majority of school districts, teacher evaluation constitutes an uneven, desultory ritual that contributes little to school improvement but much to teacher anxiety and administrator burden.s As teacher evaluation typically is conceived and practiced, it could be little more. Most teacher evaluations comprise standard checklists completed by the principal after a brief classroom observation. Principals usually base ratings on their own sense of good practice; not surprisingly, assessments based in the \"I know what I like\" school of evaluation can vary among schools and classrooms. Evaluation in this instance reflects a principal\'s individual preferences rather than a consistent set of criteria to inform either accountability or improvement. However, principal inconstancy is less problematic than it might be because most teachers receive \"satisfactory\" or \"outstanding\" ratings; \"needs improvement\" or \"unsatisfactory\" findings are rare. Administrators explain the preponderance of these salutory assessments in terms of the political and bureaucratic problems associated with teacher evaluation. Low ratings risk conflict with the teachers\' organization; evaluators do not have the skills to confi<;lently do more; support from \"downtown\" is often not forthcoming in the event of a negative or controversial appraisal; insufficient time and resources are available to respond to less than satisfactory ratings anyway.\r\nVolume 86, Number I, Fall 1984\r\n\r\nOJ 61-4681/84/860 1/193$1.25/0\r\n\r\n. 191\r\n\r\nTI-achns Coilegr Rrcord\r\n\r\nTeacher El\'aitllliion\r\n\r\nâˆ‘195\r\n\r\n\" ,ir i\r\n\r\n,:.\r\n.\'\'\'\r\n\r\n;\r\n\r\nTeadlers arc no happier with tIlt\' current state of assessment practice.

Teacher evaluation grounded in this design is a potent tool for school improvement because it can affect factors that are fundamental to how teachers and principals go about their jobs and how well they carry out their responsibilities for instruction and management.13 Most important are: teacher motivation and sense of efficacy effective communication and shared goals principal\'s instructional leadership teacher learning and development\r\n\r\n3. Teachers vary enormously in the practices that work for them and the\r\nproblems they confront in their particular classrooms.s As Good, a longtime student of teacher effectiveness, put it: \"One myth that has been discredited by classroom observation is that schooling is a constant experience with teachers curriculum.\"6 No single instructional program works for all teachers or all students; effectiveness depends on the classroom context. Thus there can be \"no single, simple method of evaluating teacher effectiveness because there is no single concept of what the teacher should be undertaking in the class room.\"7 behaving in similar ways and pursuing similar goals with a common\r\n\r\n4. Teachers\' effectiveness varies depending on the goals defined for the\r\n\r\nstudent or the class. Not only are the objectives described for students multiple and substantively diverse (e.g., academic, emotional, or social outcomes) but the strategies successful in achieving one goal (memorization of facts, for example) are often counterproductive for other instructional objectives (e.g., higher-order problem-solving skills).8 Further, the effectiveness of particular teacher practices may be curvilinear: Too much of a good thing can depress outcomes.9 Yet most teacher evaluation activities, with their closed-ended checklists, prescriptive categories, and ambiguous standards, disregard this complexity. The incompetence of principals as teacher evaluators compounds instrumen tation problems. Teachers seldom respect principals as experts on classroom practice or as skilled classroom observers,1O and in the absence of principal credibility, teachers consider the evaluation illegitimate comment on their practices in most districts, then, misgivings about the ability of teacher performance and ignore its findings. Given the state of teacher evaluation evaluation to contribute to school improvement are unsurprising. As an\r\n\r\nTEACHER MOTIVATION AND SENSE OF EFFICACY\r\nIt is axiomatic that teachers\' motivation and their sense of professional effectiveness are central to school-improvement efforts and to maintaining high-quality classroom practices. Teachers\' sense of efficacy is tied to an educator\'s primary source of satisfaction, the intrinsic rewards associated with the teaching role-service to youngsters or transmitting knowledge associated with a particular discipline,14 The extrinsic rewards attached to a teaching career are low; the ancillary benefits (with the exception of a long summer vacation) are effectively nonexistent. Yet it is difficult for teachers to collect the intrinsic rewards that motivate them and provide satisfaction. The greatest obstacle to teacher sense of efficacy, ironically, is lack of feedback about their performance-credible this point, significant and recurrent doubt about the worth of their work with information about how well they are carrying out their responsibilities.

Most professions ideally are characterized by explicit career is a relatively \"flat\" occupation, with few of the stages \'or plateaus that mark example. Thus there is little in the structure of the profession to tell teachers Another impediment to teacher sense of efficacy is inherent in the teaching\r\n\r\nsupport to make peer criticism unprofessional. So strong is this ideology of noninterference that even when teachers know about \"bad\" practices, they adminstrators.25 will make no move either to assist a colleague or inform responsible The principal, in his or her role as evaluator, thus has a crucial role to play in providing the credible feedback essential to a teacher\'s sense of efficacy.

Principals are thus able to move beyond global statements about teacher performance (\"Keep up the good work!\" \"More discipline is needed during seat work.\") to clearly, precisely, and very specifically to teachers about their performance, to\r\n\r\ndistrict priorities, and knowledge about more effective practice.s2 Teacher occasion, structure, and information that support these activities, namely, assistance to teachers through regular feedback and analysis. 3s\r\n\r\nand keeping activities of the professional staff apace of changing school needs,\r\n\r\nevaluation can be the key to principal leadership because it provides the\r\n\r\nconcrete examples gathered by observation (e.g., pointing out that a teacher teacher, commenting on her principals\' supervisory and evaluation expertise, spends most of her time teaching to the right side of the classroom).

Express district-level commitment is essential to a strong and conse teacher evaluation as a district priority and something that is taken seriously by the superintendent and central office staff. Without this support, evaluation will remain a pro forma, bureaucratic responsibility. Central office support can be shown in a numBer of ways. Support will be evident, of course, in the resources made available for principals to respond to teacher performance assessment. Less tangible elements of support are\r\n\r\nimprovement concerns will be freshly defined.

Hilliard III, Fuller E. Callaway Professor of Urban Education, College of Education, Georgia State University\r\n\r\nIn 1983 Florida\'s state legislators proposed adoption of a merit-pay plan for its public-school teachers. One requirement in the plan that met with strong opposition, and was later dropped, was that applicants for merit pay must possess a master\'s degree in the subject they teach. The ramifications of this requirement are exem plified in the following excerpt from a 1984 Education Week article.\r\nOnly 36 percent of the teachers of the year are eligible to apply for merit pay. . . . The obstacle for most teachers of the year is the 1983 legislature\'s decision that only teachers with certain master\'s degrees-those specifically pertain ing to the subject they teach-would be eligible for merit pay. Twenty-one teachers of the year have no master\'s degrees. Seven have a master\'s degree that does not meet merit-pay guidelines.Two do not know where they stand because some of those guidelines need further interpre tation. Anna Wollard was chosen the best of the 1,000 teachers in Clay County.She also was named \"competency reviewer\" for the state to evaluate teachers considered below par to see if they could be helped.\"Here your county says you are one of the best teachers and the state says you are an expert, but you can\'t get merit pay,\" Ms.Wollard said. \"It\'s deflating./I Bernice McSpadden, Bay County\'s teacher of the year, is also a trainer of the evaluators who will help determine which teachers deserve merit pay.Because she has no master\'s degree, she herself is out of the running before the evaluation process even gains ....

Note that teachers who had performed well in the classrooms were not eligible for merit pay because they did not possess a prerequisite that was thought to be necessary for successful job performance. It was not. There fore, serious questions must be raised about any \"competency test ing\" movement or presumed prerequisite for successful job perfor mance. By any standard, the quality of public education in general leaves much to be desired, as recent national reports have shown. Since virtually all children in the nation attend public schools, this is a cause for alarm. It is an even greater cause for alarm when one ponders the fact that it is public school or nothing for education of the majority of African American children. Since African American families generally do not have much discretionary surplus income that would enable them to opt for private schooling, almost all members attend public schools. 2 Undereducated or uneducated Americans will become a burden on the society. Just as important, they will be unable to lead full, satisfying, and rewarding lives. Therefore, everyone should have a stake in the provision of quality education for all, not merely for a small elite.\r\nAN ApPROPRIATE Focus ON TEACHER SKILLS IS CORRECT\r\n\r\n:- i\r\nI\r\n\r\nTeachers must be at the center of any effort to provide quality education for all children. It should be beyond debate that we need public-school teachers who are firmly grounded in academic con tent and valid professional skills. Both of these presuppose the possession by the teacher of what some have come to call \"basic skills. \" Having content to teach and knowing how to teach it are teacher-education-outcome standards that are appropriate for all teachers, regardless of race or social class. Yet, these \'\'basic skills\" are not the ultimate criteria that tell us who is or is not a good teacher. Ultimately, good teachers are known by the quality of achievement of the children they teach. Another point must be made. The quality of a student\'s achieve ment is a function both of the work of competent teachers and the presence or absence of a superior, responsive school environment. This is to say, schools and teachers alone can and do produce high quality academic achievement in children, regardless of the race or\r\n\r\n!\r\n\r\ni\r\n\r\ni\r\n1\r\n\r\n,I\r\n,\r\n\r\ni-\r\n\r\nlNational Alliance of Black School Educators, Saving the AfrlcIln American Child (Washington, D.C.: NABSE,1984).\r\n\r\nThe Journal of Negro Education\r\n\r\n305\r\n\r\n- !\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nsocioeconomic background of the children.3 It is true that some children also receive a tremendous boost from the support of their parents and community organizations which enables them to achieve in spite of poor school conditions. Further, it is true that some teachers overcome overwhelming odds and succeed with their stu dents, even when the schoo1\'s support environment is poor. Yet, neither the parents nor the poorly supported good teacher should be abandoned by those who are responsible for providing equal educational opportunity for all. School leaders are responsible for providing high-quality services to all children. School boards, state education agencies, and the Federal gov ernment, therefore, have two responsibilities to discharge in the education of children. First, they must provide a quality school environment, i.e., physical plant, equipment, supplies and mate rials, support services, and school leadership. Second, they must provide teachers who meet appropriate academic and professional standards. As simple and easy as these responsibilities may sound, school leaders are well aware that providing quality education is a complex matter that requires a wealth of financial support and courageous professional and political decision making. When the public becomes broadly dissatisfied with the schools and begins to make strident criticisms of them, many school leaders and public policy makers take the easy way out and commit themselves to simple-minded, \"quick fix\" solutions. For example, the major com mon element in most of the educational reform activity in the states is the so-called teacher-competency-testing focus. Some of the main reasons the competency tests are used are: (1) The tests are cheap to produce (usually paper-and-pencil and multiple-choice type so that they can be machine scored). (2) The minimum score require ments can be shifted up or down with ease. (3) The tests have \"face validity,\" which is the least rigorous type of validity. (4) Because the tests are controversial and generate confused discussions, fun damental scientific problems can become obscure. While the political climate is such that teacher competency test ing has been forced upon the schools as a kind of panacea for quality educational problems, it would be sad indeed if professional opin ion followed the political crowd. The real danger in acquiescing is that professionals who do so will lose the opportunity to call atten tion to fundamental problems with public-education policy, fiscal\r\n\r\nJSee the large volume of literature on \"effective schools\" that emerged in the late 19705 to midâˆ‘ 80s, particularly the summer \'1985 issue of the Journal of Negro Education on successful schooling policies, practices, and programs.\r\n\r\n306\r\n\r\nThe Journal of Negro Education\r\n\r\nI\r\n,. \'\"\r\n. _\r\n\r\nsupport, and, above all, with the nationwide lockstep approach to what I believe to be invalid competency testing itself. The matter of teacher competency testing is situated in a complex system of education. It cannot be evaluated by itself outside that system. The idea of requiring that professional educators demon strate an acceptable level of expertise is entirely appropriate. How ever, the method of that demonstration must be rational, meaning ful, and valid. For example, there still is no universal or common agreement on the elements that go to make up the content of traditional academic subjects in high school. An acceptable try at delineating such elements has been made by the College Board4with excellent results. However, the fact that such comprehensive effort is so late in coming (long after the widespread adoption of the teacher-competency-testing practice), and that even now it is neither universally known nor accepted, is evidence enough to conclude that it is absurd to believe that currently used tests are \"measuring with precision\" the academic knowledge that a teacher needs in order to be licensed. The public-school curriculum, the college curriculum, and the content of an academic competency test must overlap to an acceptable degree. If they do not, the test is not a valid measure of academic competency. Tests that do not have this overlapping element must be regarded as hurdles, not as stan dards of quality-no matter how esoteric or face-valid they may appear. The situation is even more absurd in the case of tests of \"profes sional knowledge. \" A common knowledge base in professional education has yet to be identified or supported by the majority of professional educators. While important strides have been made in educational research and development, the essential skills have not been specified in such a way that teacher educators offer common professional experiences to teachers in college preprofessional pro grams. How can precision measures be made of an undefined body of professional knowledge? More absurdity! A part of the total system of education includes student out comes. Some of the student outcomes desired can be assessed through valid paper-and-pencil tests. However, important student outcomes such as work habits, attitudes, and creativity cannot be so assessed. By allowing the paper-and-pencil teacher-competency test to become the critical filter, determining who will be allowed to teach, public policy does not guarantee standards of excellence;\r\n\r\n,.

It is on this low form of assessment of extremely questionable validity that teachers must meet mini mum \"standards. \" This then is the real problem with teacher com petency testing. The problem is not merely that tests may discrim inate or are biased against minorities; any normative nationally . standardized test will be discriminatory and biased. The problem is one of reliability and validity. The important question is, Do we learn enough from the tests to choose reliably and validly the teach ers who can get students to meet our achievement goals? The opposite important question also is not about bias against minori ties; rather, it is, Do we learn enough from the tests to choose reliably and validly those teachers who cannot get students to meet our achievement goals? One can only conclude from present practices in standardized paper-and-pertcil teacher competency testing that educators and policy makers have no serious interest in the answers to the two questions raised above. Yet, these questions cover the very goal that policy makers say has motivated them to institute competency testing in the first place. Therefore, at present the teacher-compe tency-testing movement fails on two important grounds. First, it fails on scientific grounds, even before sophisticated statistical val idation techniques are applied, since professional practice and sound content are not defined. No test-construction convention can correct for the absurdities mentionE;!d above or for many others not men tioned here. The movement fails also on even more important grounds. It fails because policy makers appear incapable of cor1âˆ‘,\"til\\ tlwir l\'t\'li.Hh\'t\' \\)11 ,1 lWpt\'ll\':,:,lv flawed technology. If this is\r\n\r\n5. There must be substantial empirically demonstrable criterion-related validity for each component of the assessment process. This means that student achievement must be utilized in criterion-related validity studies. 6. A valid and comprehensive set of measures for child outcomes-aca demic and others that are of interest-must exist. In other words, more than standardized paper-and-pencil multiple-choice test questions are needed to measure these child:\'behavior criteria. It should take little effort to determine that few and probably no presently used teacher-competency tests can meet even one of the above criteria. Yet it is possible for the criteria to be met. To do so would involve a simple matter of cost. Quality assessment is not cheap! For example, an empirical check of the true curricula offer ings would require the services of trained observers and interview ers, an examination of syllabi, and so on. No valid judgment about content validity can be made by \"expert judges\" who have not seen empirical data about course offerings and have not examined them systematically. Children\'s lives and teachers\' careers are at stake. This calls for the most rigorous application of the criteria to the field of compe tency assessment. Many criticisms have been made alleging cultural or racial bias in standardized teacher-competency tests, especially bias against African Americans. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that, while bias can be shown to exist in any standardized test, there is a more fundamental problem with teacher-competency tests. The funda mental problem is one of content or predictive validity for any teacher, regardless of race. Content validity is virtually impossible to demonstrate at present in light of the almost universal failure of educators to meet the criteria for valid competency assessment mentioned above. Moreover, predictive validity cannot be achieved for the same reason. This places a heavy burden of proof on test developers and advocates for the use of tests that have disparate impact on African-American or other populations. Developers and advocates of tests must be able to prove that tests are not arbitrary and capricious. At present this cannot be done.\r\nWORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPETENT TEACHER\r\n\r\nIt is often in the low-income, urban, public schools with heavy concentrations of cultural minority groups that student achieve ment is low. It is such school environments that prompt concern about educational quality, and about the quality of teacher com petencies. Yet, a close look at some urban teaching environments will reveal major non-teacher causes for low student achievement. 310\r\nThe Journal of Negro Education\r\n\r\nFor example, the problem of overcrowded schools causes serious interruptions in dasswork, lack of physical facilities to accommo date support services, teachers\' inability to provide for individual needs, among others. s It seems that many policy makers and edu cational leaders who are under severe pressure find it easier to require higher performance of teachers on tests than to change the terrible conditions under which many instructors are forced to work. Some of the conditions that produced low student achievement had nothing to do with teacher competency or the lack of it. It is important that these contributing factors be exposed, for they are the ones that must be changed if policy makers are serious about their stated goals for student achievement. Some of the more serious conditions that must be addressed are: 1. A confused curriculum that does not require students to enroll in courses that are prerequisites to later tests. 2. The failure to provide sufficient sections of required courses for all students who need and/or request them. 3. Patterns of teacher assignments that expose some children to teachers who are working outside their areas of academic and/ or professional preparation. 4. School facilities that do not provide for adequate and appro priate learning space. 5. A shortage of essential school supplies and equipment. 6. Failure to provide the appropriate work load for competent teachers, e. g. , overloading teachers who are expected to teach writing skills. 7. Failure to provide competent building-Ievel leaderships, i.e. , principals. 8. Failure to protect competent teachers from the imposition of a disorganized set of central-office programs, some of which are at cross-purposes with each other or with the teachers\' own well-organized lessons, e. g. , programs that allow for some chil dren in a given class to use materials that are withheld from other students in the same class who could use the materials profitably. 9. Support of student assessment practices that misdiagnose and misplace students into special classes where little is required of them academically. 10. Failure to provide at the school site or within the school district\r\n\r\n, I\r\n\r\n!\r\n\r\nI\r\n,\r\n\r\n; I\r\n\r\n\'For examples of problem of overcrowdedness and its effects, see L.Rother,\"Crowded Public School Holding Classes in Halls,\" New York Times, November 18, 1985, p. 19i and \"Intrusions Abound for Young People,\" ibid.\r\n\r\nThe Journal of Negro Education\r\n\r\n311\r\n\r\nopportunities for professional discussion to take place among peers on the solution of teaching and learning problems. 11. The tendency to allow large units to swell to enormous pro portions-large districts or schools-causing the focus of lead ers to shift from instructional priorities to power struggles. 12. Failure to reward excellent teaching in tangible and meaningful ways. The above certainly is not an exhaustive list. However, the purpose for presenting such a list here is to provide a set of. points of reference for use in evaluating the will and motivation of edu cational leaders and policy makers to move toward true quality in education. If the basic matters listed herein and on similar lists are not addressed with the same level of attention that is presently being received by teacher competency testing, then a good case can be made that policy makers are creating hurdles for teachers, not standards of quality.\r\nDATA NEEDS FROM THE TEACHER-COMPETENCY-TESTING MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nII Ii\r\n\r\nil\r\n\r\nAfter all is said and done, there are those who still might choose to argue that a \"quick and dirty\" paper-and-pencil, multiple-choice test may yield enough meaningful information that is related to teaching performance to justify its use. Because of the possibility that such an argument will be made, it is essential that data be collected which will permit an evaluation of the impact of the use . of such teacher-competency tests. An appropriate question to be raised is, What does a cost benefit analysis show about the use of existing teacher-competency tests, particularly the multiple-choice, paper-and-pencil tests that are so widely used? It is the faddish character of this national movement that calls for rigorous professional evaluation. Almost overnight, we have witnessed the spread of the teacher-competency-testing practice to the vast majority of our states. In some states, the rush to develop teacher-competency tests has produced embarrassing activities. For example, uniform state-level requirements in curric ulum in teacher education have followed rather than preceded the development of the examination intended to measure competen cies! When we speak of \"teacher-competency\" tests, we may mean any one of at least three types of tests: (1) the \"basic academic skills\" type, usually including reading comprehension, basic arithmetic computation, and sometimes written English expression; (2) the professional knowledge type; and (3) the academic knowledge type. Any one or all three types of tests may be used for several purposes, 312 The Journal of Negro Education\r\n\r\namong which are (1) certification of prerequisite skills for entry into or exit from teacher-education programs, (2) certification of profes sional competence, (3) employment and/or retention/tenure deci sions, and (4) selection of merit-pay recipients.. Complicating matters further is the fact that each of the fifty states makes unilateral decisions, usually different ones, on which types of tests to use, the purpose for which they are to be used, and the particular test that will satisfy what are perceived to be unique needs. Given three or more types of tests, three or more purposes, and an unlimited number of tests under each type, it should be clear to even the most casual observer that there is no meaningful general definition of \"teacher competency. \" Therefore, we may say that what most professionals and public- policy makers refer to when they use the term \"teacher competency\" is something that is arbitrary and situation-specific, not generalizable beyond certain school districts and states. In the mind of the general public, teacher-competency judgments are not arbitrary. They are seen as being scientific and rational, especially when standardized tests are used. Therefore, without having access to the data on the actual arbitrariness and irrationality of the present form of paper-and pencil standardized tests, almost any standardized test has face validity in the eyes of the general public. This should highlight the . need for systematic data collection. Rational judgments about the validity of tests must be based on scientific data about the real world.\r\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\' ..\r\n\'.\r\n\r\ni\r\n\r\n\"I\r\n\'\r\n\r\nEducational leaders and public-policy makers must make a strong commitment to the assessment of quality in teaching. However, quality in teaching is manifested most strongly in the quality of achievement of the students who are taught. This means that appro priate valid assessment of the achievements of students is an indis pensable prerequisite to the valid assessment of teacher competen cies. The state of the art in assessment technology is sufficiently developed to permit the creation of valid assessment of both teacher and student competency. Yet, valid assessment is not cheap assess ment. Further, valid assessment requires more than paper-and pencil, multiple-choice standardized tests. Appropriate concern for the quality of teaching includes a con cern for the quality of the school environment. No matter how competent the teacher and the student, they can be defeated in the struggle to reach school objectives when they are placed in school environments that are not conducive to achievement. Therefore, if\r\nThe Journal of Negro Education\r\n\r\n. I\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n313\r\n\r\neducators and policy makers are serious about improving the qual ity of education for all students, they must not expect the teacher competency tests to be the major tool for educational reform.\r\n\r\nI I\r\n\r\nSELECTED REFERENCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY IN STANDARDIZED TESTING\r\n\r\nIi\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\nii\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAlgera, J.

Disenchantment with the publicity surrounding the dismal scores many prospective high school graduates on these basic skills of tests led the public to question the quality of instruction provided students as well as the competencies of their teachers. One indicator of the public\'s mood was revealed in the 1979 Gallup Poll survey of the Public\'s Attitudes Toward the Public Schools. Eighty-five percent of the respondents felt that prospective teachers should be required to pass an exam demonstrating competence in subject areas and that experienced teachers and administrators should be tested every few years to see if they are keeping abreast of new developments in the Interestingly, the 1986 Gallup Poll Survey reaffirms field. these figures. The level of support for competency testing for experienced as well as beginning teachers remains at 85 %. In response to public oplnlon and the various reports calling for educational reform, many states\' initial reform proposals were directed at teachers. State boards of education and state legislatures have mandated some form of competency assessment of teachers either before admission into a teacher education program, prior to certification, or both. In addition, a growing number of states and school districts also require prospective teachers to complete an internship program before initial certification is awarded. In 1980 fifteen states required pFospective teachers to pass competency examinations By 1986, that number increased for initial certification. 200%--44 states now require competency exams for new teachers. And three states--Arkansas, Texas and Georgia--have implemented testing programs for experienced teachers. In addition to widely publicized reports on the large numbers of prospective high school graduates failing the basic skills exam and earlier reports on declining test scores on the SAT, public and legislative concern was heightened by equally alarming reports that college students in general, and the more academically able ones in particular, were rejecting teaching as a profession. This is occurring at a time when serious teacher shortages are predicted by 1990 and are already appearing in some school districts in math, science, bilingual and special education.\r\n\r\nWith fewer qualified students entering the and lesser profession and the predicted teacher shortages by 1990, how will impending crisis? Hopefully, the the nation respond to this standards being proposed now for entry into teacher education programs or for initial certification will not be lowered to increase the supply of licensed teachers.\r\n\r\nProblems with Current Assessment Methods\r\n\r\nMost educators recognize that current teacher competency tests are woefully inadequate to assess the knowledge and skills Test items do not required to be an effective teacher. encompass a comprehensive understanding of educational theory and practice nor do they assess a candidate\'s ability to apply knowledge and judgement to real life situations. In her content analysis of a sample test from the National Teacher Examinations Test of Professional Knowledge, Linda Darling-Hammond discovered that less than 10% of the questions required knowledge of theory, research, or facts pertaining to teaching and learning; and that 40% did not have a \"right\" She also found that the questions relied on a answer. simplistic view of teaching and were not adequate to assess what skilled and knowledgeable teachers should know. Recognizing that certification requirements vary from state to state; that current tests, which require only factual recall and little (if any) professional judgement, do not adequately assess what teachers need to know; and that state licensing bodies tend to raise or lower standards or issue emergency certificates in response to teacher supply and demand, Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers, advanced the idea of a national examination for teachers that would be developed, administered and controlled by the profession. This proposed examination would set a national standard for teachers that would measure competency in 1) subject-matter knowledge above minimum levels, 2) the ability to make and justify instructional decisions, and 3) verbal and mathematical reasoning ability.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL BOARD OF PROFESSIONAL TEACHING STANDARDS\r\n\r\nAn outgrowth of Shanker\'s call for a national examination for teachers and a major recommendation of the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy\'s Task Force on Teaching as a Profession\'s report, A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century, is the proposed creation of a National Board of Professional Teaching Standards. The Board will be a non governmental body organized with a regional and state membership structure. It will be responsible for setting high standards for what teachers need to know and be able to do, and will Highly competent certify teachers who meet that standard.\r\n\r\nteachers will comprise the majority membership of the Board; and consist of other education professionals, the balance will public officials, and lay persons. In defining function of the Board, the Carnegie Task the Force provided the following guidelines: A National Board for Professional Teaching Standards should be created to establish standards for high levels of competence the teaching profession, to assess the in qualifications of those seeking board certification, and to grant certificates to those who meet the standards. 1. The Board would grant Teacher\'s Certificates that attest to a high level of competence. It would also grant Advanced Teacher\'s Certificates that indicate teaching competence and demonstrated outstanding ability for school leadership. In developing its standards, the Board should determine what teachers need to know and what they should be able to do. The Board should work with institutions engaged in preparing prospective teachers to assist them in preparing candidates for certification. A majority of the members of the National Board should be elected by Board-certified teachers. for Board certification should be able to Candidates choose the means of preparation that best suits their needs. The assessment of candidates for Board certification will require decentralized geographically administration. State or regional organizations of certified teachers should be created by the National Board to oversee Board functions at the regional and state level.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nState licensing authorities, which will continue to be responsible for licensing teachers to practice, should strengthen their standards and involve teachers in designing these new standards.\r\n1.\r\n\r\nBoard certification initially would be voluntary. In time, the Board\'s standards should be incorporated in the structure of state standards. Anticipating the availability of Board-certified teachers, state officials should draft plans to offer districts incentives to hire such teachers in\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nappropriate roles, and such distribution of different tax capacity. 3.\r\n\r\nto provide for the equitable teachers among districts of\r\n\r\nparticipants in alternate route programs Licensure of should meet a standard that is at least as high as that required of applicants from regular programs.\r\n\r\nAs post-graduate programs of teacher education are developed, the states and voluntary accreditation organizations should set and vigorously enforce high standards for such programs. Appropriate state authorities should announce a date beyond which emergency licenses to teach will not be granted and licensed teachers will not be permitted to teach \"out of subject. \" The charge of the Board will be to define the professional knowledge base for teaching and develop standards for the profession based on this knowledge. It will also develop and administer a national assessment for the certification of new teachers and award advanced certificates for those experienced teachers who seek it. This assessment process will not be trivialized by requlrlng only a paper and pencil, multiple choice test currently used in Instead the Board assessment will teacher certification tests. probably include a number of formats to assess general knowledge as well as subject matter and pedagogical knowledge. Teaching skills will be assessed independently or simultaneously with other demonstrations of pedagogical knowledge and skills. Although the Board\'s certification procedure is in the formative stage, it is proposed that the assessment process will include a variety of formats. For example, essay responses, video presentations, or computer simulations of actual classroom situations could be used and there probably would not be just one right. answer. The purpose of these tests would be to assess the candidates\' thought processes and decision-making sills based on known principles of effective practice. Objective tests to measure a teacher\'s knowledge of subject matter could also be included. The following are the proposed categories of teacher knowledge upon which the national assessment will be based:\r\n1.\r\n\r\nincluding General/Liberal Education, reading, math, writing, and reasoning. Content occur. knowledge in the domains in\r\n\r\nbasic\r\n\r\nskills\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nwhich teaching will\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nContent-Specific Pedagogical Knowledge--transformation subject matter knowledge into knowledge for teaching.\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nGeneral Knowledge Pedagogical Principles and Practice- of pts. effective teaching conce Curricular Knowledge--knowledge of curriculum materials or curricular alternatives for a given course or topic.

They will be evaluated on the basis of how well they work with students and their colleagues. An induction program such as this will give new teachers the time and opportunity to learn from experienced teachers. In addition to The certification process will be voluntary. basic certification, those teachers who choose to do so can pursue advanced board certification. The new Board would issue two certificates--a Teacher\'s Certificate that would establish high entry level standards for beginning teachers and an Advanced Teacher\'s Certificate that would signify the highest levels of competence as a teacher. It also proposes to develop a code of ethics, maintain a register of Teachers and Advanced Teachers, and establish standards for recertification comparable to those in other professions. The Carnegie Foundation has provided the initial funding for creation of the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards and for development of a national assessment procedure. The Foundation recognizes that it will be a major task to create and implement an assessment program in a way that will be valid, equitable, economically and politically feasible, professionally responsible, and publicly accountable. Therefore, it has made a ten-year commitment to fund the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy to oversee the entire process.\r\n\r\nControversial Issues Teacher Performance\r\n\r\nThroughout been much opposition to the years there has testing teachers Opponents of for certification and licensure. testing argue passing a paper and pencil test does not that accurately predict future classroom performance. We agree. Passing a test should not be the only criterion used for hiring a teacher. But failing the test is sufficient reason not to other qualities matter if the prospective hire someone. No teacher lacks minimal skills.\r\nMinority Representation in the Profession\r\n\r\nAnother criticism opponents of teacher competency testing is its adverse impact on minority teachers. Studies show make Hispanics, and Native Americans have a much higher that Blacks, failure rate than Whites on the National Teacher Examination and state competency tests. Data show that disproportionate numbers of minorities are being screened out of the teaching profession. In 1970 Blacks made up 12% of the elementary and secondary In 1985 the National Center for Educational teaching force. Statistics reported that Blacks comprised only 8% of the teaching pool and projections indicate that, if pass rates do not improve and the decline in the numbers of black students choosing teaching as a career continue, the percentage of black teachers in this country will shrink to 5% of the teaching force by 1990. Projections for other minorities being well represented in th teaching force are not promising either. To give an idea of how Blacks, Hispanics and native Americans are fairing on certification examinations, some general pass rates for 1984 follow: 43% in Alabama; 26% in California; 36% in Florida, 34% in Georgia and 15% in Louisiana. When you look at pass rate statistics and actual head count, the consequences are more devastating. In 1984 Cole researched the impact of testing policies on Blacks and reported the following: in 1981 approximately 200 black teachers out of In Florida, a total 5,500 were certified--3. 6 percent of the total population of certified teachers. In Louisiana since 1978 state institutions have produced approximately 55 black certified teachers per year. In Texas during the first two testing cycles in 1984, the first year of competency testing for teachers, only 55 black teachers were certified for all 1,200 school districts in the state. In a review of teacher statistics in ten southern states a November, 1985 issue of Education Week found that the number of black teachers had fallen by 6. 4%, while in the same period the number of teachers had grown by 1%. total This decrease in\r\n\r\nin the teaching profession is occurring at a time minorities when the American school-age population will soon be more than 30% minority and 23 out of the 25 largest school districts already have Unless a majority of minority students enrolled. an intervention is introduced, as current teachers mechanism grow older and retire, minority teachers--especially Blacl{s and Hispanics--are an \"endangered species.\" AFT believes the education community cannot ignore the fact that teacher competency testing will contribute to an even greater underrepresentation of minorities in the teaching But we must recognize that, in addition to testing, profession. the decline of minorities in the teaching pool is due to several other factors: the poor education of black and Hispanic students in this country at all levels; their declining participation in higher education in general; and, the expanding opportunities for minority professionals in other fields. In order to understand and address the shortage of minority teachers in general, and black teachers in particular, we must plug the leaks in the educational pipeline that is responsible Berryman (1983) cites the following for producing teachers. data that demonstrates the problems within the education pipeline for Blacks: In 1972 black students represented 12.7% of the 18-year-olds, 10.5% of the high school graduates and only 8.7% of college freshman. In 1976, even though they were 12.3% of the 22-year-olds, black students were only 6.5% of the baccalaureate recipients. In 1982, black students were 15.1% of high school enrollment, 11.5% of high school graduates and 10.3% In essence, the further along the of college enrollments. pipeline, the greater the underrepresentation of Blacks in the education system. Another factor contributing to the underrepresentation of minorities in the profession is the drop in the interest of minority undergraduates in education as a major. From 1966 to 1978 there was a 60% decline of black students selecting education as a major compared to a 30% decline for all under Interest in business and health related majors graduates. increased for Blacks, as well as i.l, all students during this period. In the long term the single most âˆ‘ itical way to improve the teaching pool is to develop high school graduates with sufficient skills to perform well in college. A number of successful programs have been developed to attract minority elementary and secondary school students to careers in medicine, math and science and to strengthen their basic academic skills. Some of these exemplary programs could be expanded to include teaching and serve the needs of a broader group of disadvantaged minority students. believes AFT state national, a concerted and local effort levels must be made at the to address issues of\r\n\r\n, \r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nof minority teachers as an area of recruitment and retention critical shortage. We must actively encourage bright minority students who opportunities available to them to have other There should be programs at the consider teaching as a career. high school and college levels to identify talented minority students who are potential teachers; diagnose their academic strengths and weaknesses; strengthen their general school performance; prepare them for college; and, while in college, prepare them to improve their performance on college-entry and teaching-entry tests. We support scholarships and loan programs at the state, local, and federal levels that designate funds for minorities, and we support targeting teacher recruitment and intern programs at institutions that attract significant numbers of minorities. Programs designed to increase the attractiveness of the teaching profession--better salaries, restructured work environments, more career opportunities within teaching--will attract more able minorities and whites to the profession.\r\n\r\nAFT POSITIONS CERTIFICATIOH\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nTEACHER COMPETENCY TESTING AND HATIOHAL BOARD\r\n\r\nA natural outgrowth of the movement to test new teachers is the call to test experienced teachers. We support testing new teachers as a screening device to keep those with obvious academic deficiencies out of the profession. However, a more reliable means of evaluating the performance of veteran teachers is by making ongoing classroom observations and developing equitable evaluation systems that give an adequate assessment of a teacher\'s subject-matter knowledge and instructional skills. Superior teachers should be encouraged; mediocre and poor teachers should be given assistance to help them improve; and those who remain unsatisfactory should be terminated. AFT supports the need to assure continuing competence in the profession. This will not be accomplished by subjecting experienced. teachers to trivial paper and pencil, multiple choice tst. It will only be accomplished by developing a comprehensive program which includes recruiting talented teacher candidates with a liberal arts background and at least one academic major; passing a rigorous examination for initial certification that assesses the knowledge and skills a professional teacher should possess, an induction program which includes a one-year internship under the supervision of an experienced, highly competent teacher; and a residency period with peer assistance and review in which progress would continuously be reviewed and assessed. Successful completion of such a comprehensive induction program provides a quality assurance measure to the public of the competence of new teachers entering the profession. Such quality control procedures build public confidence in teachers and will, in the future, eliminate the public\'s need to require superficial paper\r\n\r\nand pencil competence.\r\n\r\ntesting\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\nexperienced teachers as an indicator of\r\n\r\nWe are concerned about the lack of resources available to predominately Hispanic schools and the historically black and substandard educational opportunities which contribute to inadequate performance by a disproportionate school and test The solution to this problem is not percentage of minorities. to abandon tests or lower standards but tmprove the quality students recei ve. t:::ft The NEA, which has :: of educat ion mi nori ty traditionally spearheaded the anti-testing forces in the past, its position at their 1985 convention and now supports changed competency testing for new teachers. Creation of a National Board for Professional Standards would disarm arguments opposing testing of teachers for certification. A rigorous comprehensive national teachers examination, similar to those required to medicine and law, would involve more than passing a paper and pencil test where a knowledge of test-taking skills is almost as important as content knowledge. Certification by a National Professional Standards Board is a means by which teachers, proven to have achieved a level of expertise, can command salaries competitive with other highly skilled professionals. Board certification justifies giving teachers the direct responsibility for instructional and curriculum decisions, budgetary matters and professional evaluation at the local school site. A national professional standards board will also influence teacher preparation programs around the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'),(6962,52,2,50,0,'Teacher Testing and National Board Certification'),(6963,52,2,49,0,'Education Reform'),(6964,52,2,41,0,'A white paper about teacher testing and national professional standards board certification'),(6965,52,2,39,0,'AFT'),(6966,52,2,48,0,'American Federation of Teachers,.

Minimum passing scores for the SAT range from combined scores of 745 to 1000.Of the states requiring a test for certi fication, rather than for entry into a program, six states have devel oped their own tests, ten states use the NTE Core Battery, and ten states use the NTE Specialty Area tests. Passing scores vary. For example, in the NTE Specialty Area Test, Education in the Elementary School, the grading scale is from 250 to 990 poirits and the minimum passing scores vary from 480 to 600 points (Goertz and Pitcher, 1984, pp. 2-3. ) Prospective teachers in California who have not graduated from a state-approved academic waiver program are required to score above a specific minimum cutoff score on the National Teacher Examination (NTE). Since 1983, prospective teachers are also required to take the California Basic Educational Skills Test ( CBEST), which is designed to measure basic skills in mathematics, reading, and writing. T hey must take the test for diagnostic purposes before they can student teach and must pass it before they can be certified. Virtually the only point on which all observers of the current trend in teacher testing can agree is that the use of such tests can be highly problematic. Some have argued .that the use of virtually any standard ized competency examination is fundamentally unfair, because few, if any, competency examinations have been found to be valid predictors of teacher effectiveness in the classroom. T he National Education As sociation (NEA) has been quite cautious about the place of testing in teacher recruitment, selection, evaluation, and promotion. T he NEA also contends that there are other legitimate reasons for opposing the use of such standardized examinations. In a 1980 report, Measurement\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nAccess:\r\n\r\nProceedings\r\n\r\n1984\r\n\r\nETS\r\n\r\nForty-Fifth Invitational Conference (Princeton. N.J.: Educational Testing Service.\r\n\r\n1985).\r\n\r\nTeacher Competency Testing and Its Effect on Minorities: Reflection and Recommendations\r\n\r\nBERNARD R. GIFFORD\r\n\r\nDean, Graduate School of Education University of California\r\n\r\nthe Move to Test Teachers\r\nIn the last decade, state education departments, sometimes on their own, more often at the insistence of governors and state legislatures, have placed added emphasis on the use of standardized examinations for prospective teachers. In nearly every case, state education depart ments have established a cutoff score, prohibiting teacher candidates from proceeding any further in their pursuit of a teaching position until they have jumped over this hurdle. In some instances, state edu cation departments have mandated testing programs for fully certified teachers already in the classroom. Since the issuance of A Nation at\r\n\r\nRisk: T he Imperative for Educational Reform in April 1983 by the\r\nNational Commission on Excellence in Education, the move toward teacher testing has become a stampede. By 1984, over half of the states had implemented some form of testing requirement forâˆ‘ prospective teachers. By 1988, nine more states will join their ranks, having already passed the necessary ena bling legislation. T he tests vary from state to state in terms of when\r\n\r\nand Testing: An\r\n\r\nNEA\r\n\r\nPerspective. the NEA argues that standardized\r\n\r\nexaminations are: 1) \"biased against those who are economically dis advantaged or who are culturally and linguistically different\"; 2) \"in valid, unreliable, out of date and restricted to the measurement of cognitive skills\"; 3) \"used by book publishers and testing companies to promote their financial interests rather than to improve measurement and instruction\"; 4) \"used by the media as a basis for invidious com parisons.\" T hus, the NEA say s they should not be \"used to evaluate teachers\" (NEA, 1980, p. 51).\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nthey must be passed, whether basic skills only are tested, or whether general knowledge and/ or subject matter mastery tests must be passed as well, and what the minimum passing score is for a given test. In November 1984, Educational Testing Service reported that 17 states require an individual to pass a test prior to his or her entry into a teacher education program. T his is usually a standard college en trance test or a test of basic skills. Including 12 of these states, a total of 28 states have a testing requirement for teacher credentialing. A\r\n\r\nThe NEA\'S position is not shared by the other major teachers\' profes sional organization, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). The AFT supports the use of \"accurate and appropriate measures to certify teachers\" (quoted in Scherer, 1983, p. 49). The AFT\'S position more accurately reflects teacher sentiment. According to the 1984 Gallup Poll of Teachers\' Attitudes Toward the Public Schools, 63 percent of teacher respondents expressed support for \"a state board examination to prove their knowledge in the subjects they plan to teach\" (Gallup, 1984, p. 104). There\' is some evidence that teacher support at the grass-roots level for competency testing may be a defensive reaction, a response by teachers to public fears that the schools are being staffed with teachers who are professionally incompetent. Also supporting the use of competency examinations for teachers have been state education department officials and many deans of schools of education. Most state superintendents have come out in support of teacher examinations because this has proven to be an ef fective means of communicating to the larger polity their commitment to \"standards of excellence.\" Commenting on the work of the ad hoc Committee on Competency Tests and Performance Assessment of the Council of Chief State School Officers, the committee\'s chief of staff was reported to have stated that the committee\'s greatest concern is that \"cutoff scores may not reflect standards of excellence but may merely reflect consensus and the desire to maintain teacher supply in the state. . . . What we found is that many states that have required competency tests have done it for political purposes and are not better off as far as standards are concerned\" ( Scherer, pp. 59-60). Many deans of schools of education have supported examinations for prospective teachers as a means of improving overall student qual ity in their units, even where the \"cost\" of this quality increase can be measured in an immediate enrollment decline. Some deans taking this position have argued that these short-term declines in enrollment will be more than offset by long-term increases in enrollment of higher quality prospective teachers. Some observers have cited what they believe is evidence for this \"addition by subtraction\" policy. For ex ample, the University of Oregon experiencedfor the first time in its long history-a waiting list to enroll in the university\'s teacher educa tion program, following its decision to raise admission standards (Pugach and Raths, 1983). What is not clear is whether Oregon actu ally increased the relative attractiveness of teaching vis-a-vis other programs of study for academically accomplished students, or merely\r\n\r\nVI +:\'-\r\n\r\nimproved its student body by cutting off admission to students who would have been admitted under former admission standards. Unless teaching attracts a greater proportion of academically ac complished students, the \"addition by subtraction\" argument remains unconfirmed and troublesome. For a school of education dean in a college or university experiencing overall enrollment declines, where there is great counter-pressure to relax standards in order to increase enrollments, the \"addition by subtraction\" plan may be considered a risky path to take. Going beyond teacher testing to evaluation of pre-professional pro grams in education, some state legislatures have mandated the use of standardized examinations in teacher recruitment, selection and eval uation, and as a means for holding institutions of higher education and departments of education accountable for the performance of their current students and recent graduates. In 1984, the Tennessee State Legislature passed a law requiring the State Commissioner of Education to place on probation for one year those schools and de partments of education in which 30 percent or more of the students failed the state\'s basic skills test. When the student failue rate exceedsâˆ‘ 30 percent for two consecutive years, the law requires the commis sioner to revoke the institution\'s accreditation for teacher training programs. A comparable law passed in florida resulted in 18 out of the state\'s 25 teacher training institutions losing state approval of one or more of their educational programs (Stoddart, Losk and Benson, August 1984, p. 7). Many may claim that this is a \"punitive\" approach and they also, quite correctly, point out that other professional schools are not sub ject to a similar fate when their students fail licensure examinations at higher than acceptable rates. For example, in California the failure rate for the February sitting of the state bar examination usually is about 72 percent. While California law schools are rank-ordered ac cording to their student passing rate for some purposes by the state bar, no one has suggested that a law school should have its accredita tion revokea because of the relatively poor showing of some of its students on the state bar examinations, despite the belief of those who score the essay portion that the writing ability of candidates for the bar is on a steady decline. Perhaps because of the differential in status ascribed to the candi dates sitting for the respective examinations, prospective lawyers as a group may be viewed as professionals responsible in good part for\r\n\r\nUj Uj\r\n\r\ntheir own fortunes and performance, while prospective teachers are not afforded this measure of respect and are assumed to be a \"prod uct\" turned out by their school. While the common term is \"teacher training institution,\" the counterpart for the legal praCtitioner is not a \"lawyer training institution.\" The assumption underlying the view of both sets of institutions is one that belongs in the marketplace: Many good students want to go to law school. When such students see that the graduates of certain law schools are more likely to pass the bar examination, the best stu dents will apply to these schools and on down the line, with few stu dents applying to the schools with very poor pass rates. The inverse of this situation is sometimes seen in schools of education. The assump tion is that the schools of education need to find students and, if left unrestrained, they will pull in-off the street, if they have to-just about anyone, with no regard for past academic performance or for professional potential. Although we know that this exaggeration is rarely true, it has been true enough, often enough, to raise the suspi cions of many governmental policy makers, inside and outside of the educational establishment.\r\n\r\nAttacks on Testing\r\nWith greater reliance on both student and teacher testing, the contro versy surrounding greater use of standardized examinations has inten sified. In addition to the NE A, among those most reluctant to endorse the increased reliance on standardized examinations are groups sensi tive to the unique problems confronting prospective teachers from mi nority backgrounds. The reluctance of these groups is understandable given the tests\' effects on such individuals. In California-according to the Commis sion on T eacher Credentialing (cTc)-of 6,644 candidates from minor ity groups who took the first California CBEST exam in 1983, 3,854, or 58 percent, failed. The highest failure rate was among Black candi dates. of the 2,040 Black candidates who took the exam, only 530 were able to proceed with their plans to be teachers, a paltry 26 per cent. For other minority groups, the test results were not much better: only 834 out of 2,133, or 39 percent of Mexican-American candidates passed, and only 50 percent, or 637 out of 1,259 Asian-American can didates passed the CBEST exam. In comparison, the passing rate for\r\n\r\nWhite candidates was 76 percent, with 18,856 of the 24,540 candidates passing (CTC, December 1984). The problems associated with these high minority failure rates are made all the more serious by our increasing need for qualified Black, Hispanic, Asian-American, and Native-American teachers at a time of rapid demographic change. Again, California provides a dramatic ex ample of national demographic trends. In the 1981-1982 school year, \' the state\'s total public school population was only 56.4 percent non Hispanic White. For grades K-3, the majority of the state\'s public school pupils were: 34.1 percent Hispanic; 9.1 percent Black; 6.8 per cent Asian American or Pacific Islander; and 0.8 percent Native American. If current trends continue, by 1995 more than 50 percent of the state\'s total public school population will come from a minority group. If California\'s public schools indeed do exceed a 50 percent minority enrollment, they would join most of the nation\'s 35 largest city school districts, the majority of which now have overwhelmingly minority enrollments. Needless to say, high minority pupil enrollment rates, if unchecked by dramatic interventions, could result in a high degree of conflict between minority parents and a largely non-minor ity teaching staff, similar to the one that plagued public education during the 1960s in many of the nation\'s larger cities. The rates of failure on these teacher examinations reflect two omi nous trends: First, interest in teaching on the part of many well educated students, especially talented minority students, has declined precipitously in the last 15 years. As the teacher surplus of the 1970s drastically reduced opportunities and salaries for teaching, college stu dents increasingly chose other majors. Moreover, as new career op portunities outside education have opened up for them, talented minority and women students, who earlier would have entered teach ing, have chosen other fields. The proportion of college-bound stu dents who said they intended to major in education fell from 24 percent in 1969 to less than five percent in 1982. The decline has been particularly evident for highly qualified minority candidates and women. Second, colleges and universities are failing to guarantee that their graduates, including many minority graduates, can read with comprehension, write literately, and perform routine mathematical computations. This trend is a clear manifestation of the general failure of many colleges and universities to exercise proper leadership and authority over their educational programs. The report of the Associa tion of American Colleges ( AAC), Integrity in the College Curriculum:\r\n\r\nA Report to the Academic Community, argues that \"evidence of de cline and devaluation is everywhere.\" Moreover,\r\nthere is so much confusion as to the mission of the American college and university that it is no longer possible to be sure why a student should take a particular program of courses. Is the curriculum an invitation to philosophic and intellectual growth or a quick exposure to the skills of a particular vocation7 Or is it both7 Certainty on such matters disap peared under the impact of new knowledge and electives in the late nineteenth century. T he subsequent collapse of structure and control in the course of study.has invited the intrusion of programs of ephemeral knowledge developed without concern for the criteria of self-discovery, critical thinking, and exploration of values that were for so long central to the baccalaureate y ears. T he curriculum has given way to a market place philosophy : it is a supermarket where students are shoppers and professors are merchants of learning. Fads and fashions, the demands of popularity and success, enter where wisdom and experience should pre vail. Does it make sense for a college to offer a thousand courses to a student who will only take 367 T he marketplace philosophy refuses to establish common expecta tions and norms. Another victim of this posture of irresponsibility is the general education of the American. college undergraduate, the institu tfonal course requirements outside the major. T hey lack a rationale and cohesion or, even worse, are almost lacking altogether. Electives are being used to fatten majors and diminish breadth. It is as if no one cared, so long as the store stay s open (p. 12).\r\n\r\nIf these trends continue-and make no mistake about it, they will as long as colleges and universities, ignoring the implications of the find ings contained in Integrity in the College Curriculum, continue to per mit these students to chart their own intellectual development-the situation can only deteriorate further. Unaided by the collective intel ligence of the academy and a commitment to improving the attractive ness of the teaching profession, the supply of talented, well-educated teachers from minority groups will continue to nosedive, a result that is as disturbing as it is unacceptable. Equally serious is the prospect that when minority group pupils, especially those contemplating teaching careers, learn that many prospective minority teachers are judged not good enough to teach, they may lose confidence in their own abilities, reaching the conclusion that the teaching profession is \"off limits\" to students from minority groups. Also, students from these groups, who desperately need to see successful role models, would be denied access yet again to exemplars of success. Even before recent reports revealed the potential for negative effects\r\n\r\non minority group representation in the teaching force, there was op position to teacher competency testing. Many who are sensitive to the unique problems of minorities have been vocal and active in their opposition. Among them is Professor Walter A. Mercer of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, a historically Black college supported by the state. Professor Mercer contends, quite persuasively, that the policy of the Florida State Board of Education that imposes a minimum SAT cutoff score of 835 for prospective teacher training can didates will have a devastating impact on the future supply of Black teachers. Predicting that \"future teachers from groups could become vanishing breeds,\" Professor Mercer calls on policy makers to estab lish alternative teacher education admission requirements (Mercer, 1984, p. 29). Mercer\' s concerns are borne out by the report that only 2 00 Black teachers were part of a total of 5,500 teachers certified in Florida in 1981. These low numbers were mirrored in the pass rates on Florida\'s Teacher Competency Examination, given for the first time in 1983: 90 percent of White candidates passed, 35 percent of Black candidates, 51 percent of Hispanic candidates, and 63 percent of Asian candidates. Also passing were all four of the Native American candidates who sat for the examination ( Smith, 1984, p. 7 ). The pass rates are no more encouraging elsewhere. The first admin istration of the Texas examination for prospective teachers eliminated 84 percent of the Black candidates and 65 percent of the Hispanic candidates on the basis of the mathematics examination; 87percent of \' the Black candidates and 65 percent of the Hispanic candidates failed the reading test; and 80 percent of the Black candidates and 56 percent of the Hispanic candidates failed the writing test (G.P. Smith, p. 7 ). A group of Texas researchers has predicted that, if the present trend is uninterrupted in Texas by 1988, since candidates must pass all three examinations-as they must in California-96 percent of Black candi dates and 84 percent of Hispanic candidates will be denied permission to teach on the basis of their reading tests alone.On a national level, if the currertdy observable trend continues unabated, \"along with nor mal rates of attrition through retirements and teacher burnout, minor ity representation in the national teaching force could be reduced to less than 5 percent by 1990\" (G.P. Smith p. 8). The picture painted by these numbers is as horrifying as it is unac ceptable. Therefore, it would be easy to be diverted by the nightmar ish quality these statistics create. We are (ully aware of the devastating\r\n\r\n\\Jl 0\'\\\r\n\r\n--r----: ..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyoung people who have a strong de effect this reality creates for the are selves by educating our young. We sire to build a career for them for minority children in cur lication equally well aware of the full imp minority people may re classrooms who will believe that rent and futu to claim \"racism\" and to insist e is not teach. The first reaction of som t be adopted for minority nate certification standards mus that alter l will be ground into the dirt ntia candidates. Otherwise, human pote promise of equality placed, yet the promise of democracy and the and tion remains whether this prospect again, in deep jeopardy. The ques iciency tests. necessarily rules out the use of prof\r\n\r\nnot believe that they have the capacity to achieve a 700 score on the SAT, with three years to prepare for the test, when they are given a total of 400 points simply for answering a single question in each of the two sections of the test, and when they have a significant chance of scoring 460 by a purely random marking of the test. Finally, I support the NCAA\'S action because I believe that Black parents, Black educators and the Black community must insist that Black children be taught and that they learn whatever subject matter is necessary to excel on diagnostic and all other skills tests. (Edwards, 1983, p. 37)\r\n\r\nIn Favor of Competency Testing of Minority Candidates\r\nWe can gain many insights into the need for proficiency testing by analogy to the argument of sociology professor Harry Edwards at the University of California at Berkeley regarding the NCAA\'S \" Rule 48\", which sparked \"what is probably the most heated race-related contro versy within the NCAA since the onset of widespread racial integration in major college sports programs during the 1950s and 1960s \" (Edwards, 1983, p. 3 3). The rule stipulated that \"beginning in 1986, freshman athletes who want to participate in sports in any of the na tion\'s 27 Division I colleges and universities must have attained a 7 minimum score of 7 (combined) on the SAT or a score of 15 (compos 00 ite score) on the American College Test and must have achieved a C average in 11 designated high school courses, including English, math ematics, social sciences and physical sciences \" (ibid.). The concern voiced by many Black leaders was intense and immedi ate.Some were angered because they were not consulted in the formu lation of the rule, others claimed that the setting of the SAT minimum score was arbitrary. Still others stated that the SAT and the ACT are racist diagnostic tests, biased in favor of White students, and that the proposed cutoffs imposed unfair penalties on Black athletes. Edwards took a stand supporting the enforcement of the rule. He agreed that the cutoff scores may well have been arbitrary, but found them so arbitrarily low as to constitute no standard at all. Edwards stated:\r\nFurther, were I not to support Rule 48 I would risk communicating to , Black youth in particular that I, a nationally known Black educator, do\r\n\r\nWe need to couple support of such rules for minimum competency with the insistence that we work together to ensure that minority chil dren receive the education necessary to enable them to score competi tively on examinations from SAT, to NTE, to CBEST. We must also insist that state public official S. in and out of the education establishment, develop, fund, vigorously monitor, and intelligently evaluate targeted school improvement programs so that minority students at all levels can become more competitive on all examinations of scholastic achievement.In taking this line, I am not contending that these exami nations are problem-free, or totally unbiased.In some instances, these tests may be biased in favor of or against any particular ethnic, racial, or cultural group. They certainly are heavily class-biased. Allan Nairn said of the SAT: \"In sum, it is advertised as a test of \'scholastic aptitude\' .. . used by colleges to accept and reject applicants ostensibly on the basis of merit. For many students, the SAT may be more a reflection of their social class than of their potential for accomplishment inside or beyond the classroom \" ( 1980, p.65 2). Mary Frances Berry furthers this argument with her assertion that \"a major differential [among test scores] was not between Black and White students, but between students from well-off families and stu dents from poor families. The better off the family, the higher the score-for Whites and Blacks\" ( Berry quoted in Edwards, p. 34). In deed, the College Board\'s Profiles, College-Bound Seniors, 1983 shows exactly that. The relationship between family income and test scores is highly significant. While not as high, the relationship be tween level of parental education and SAT scores of high school seniors is also very substantial. We must interrupt this cycle of failure. Certainly, standardized tests cannot, to quote Washington Post columnist William Raspberry, \"measure patience, love of children and learning, the ability to main tain order, and a hundred other things that make up teacher compe tency. But the tests can measure whether a teacher has learned the 56\r\n\r\nV1 00\r\n\r\nbasics of pedagogic techniques (which we consider important, else why would we mandate education courses for teachers?) and whether a teacher has a solid grasp of the material to be taught ... . I assume that the reason minority applicants fare worse on the tests than Whites is that they themselves are victims of inferior schooling\" (quoted in Brott, 1983, p. 3 7 ). I fully agree with this view and would add that, whereas I would not rely on a test to tell me who had the personal warmth and caring required of a good teacher, and I would not expect a test to tell me who from among a pool of applicants has ambition, drive, or dedica tion, I would expect a test to give me some reliable information about the basic competencies of a pool of applicants. I would not want such a competency test to generate a list of prospective students in a rank order, because we do not know enough about individual differences to do that. Further, I believe that, as much as measuring potential apti tude, perhaps even more so, tests such as the SAT and well-con structed, appropriately-used tests such as the CBEST measure both what students have learned and show how well students are able to apply their learning to what the test asks of them. What all of the test results we have discussed thus far indicate is that we are still neglecting the children of low-income families. The test results show that those who enter our system with the most at their disposal are the ones who will get the most out of our system. The system continues to be \"theirs.\" If we were to do as Arnold M.Galle gos, dean of the College of Education at Northern Arizona University suggests and set \'apart alternative methods for certifying minority group members who want to teach (Gallegos, p. 361 ), then we would be perpetuating the cycle, however benign our intent. If we take note of Henry Levin\'s provocative finding that each addi tional point scored by teachers on their SAT verbal subtest can be translated into a net gain of .175 points to the verbal scores of Black students and .179 to the verbal scores of White students (Weaver, p. 110), then we have that much more impetus to work to provide educa tional settings that would give students from low-income backgrounds the same chance at passing teacher credentialing examinations whether SAT, CBEST or NTE-as students from middle-income back grounds.As Dean Gallegos quite correctly states, historically we have tended to \"blame the victims,\" that is, the minority students, for their failure on examinations, not the institutions that prepare them (ibid. p. 63 1 ).\r\n.\r\n\r\nIf we are to interrupt the cycle of failure, we must take direct action to provide all students in or public schools with quality education that is responsive to their real needs. We cannot begin this effort without well-qualified teachers, including well-qualified minority teachers. To meet the challenge we face, we need to take steps to ensure a larger pool of qualified minority teachers,\' while also maintaining and im proving quality standards. We know full well that all of the knowledge and skills that are tested are learnable. Students can achieve acceptable test scores if we teach them what they need to know. This means teaching all of the skills and understanding that they will require if they are to function well in the contemporary world and also be prepared to make the best adap tations and choices in their lives as they move into the future. All of this is said in full acknowledgement of the pain and suffering that is experienced by those who are not presently armed with the knowl edge and the skills required to pass present minimum competency examinations. What I am about to propose will bring a transitional period of short-run disappointment for some who will be locked out of the teacher training programs they wish to enter. But it will finally put a stop to \"victim blaming\" measures that have created more problems each time they have been applied in place of long-range, well articu lated solutions. Toward that end, I propose a three-step, comprehensive program to include: early identification of minority and low-income students who have a commitment to teaching; intensive university and postgraduate teacher training; and programs and rewards for outstanding, effective teachers once they are in the classroom.\r\n\r\nStep One: The early identification and intensive training of minority students who wish to teach\r\nAs early as high school, students who have expressed an interest in teaching as a career would be selected to participate in a special uni versity pre-professional teacher preparation program. Program ad mission standard s would consider potentia l for growth and an exceptionally strong willingness to learn, in addition to the tradition al criteria of grades and past achievements. Special efforts would be\r\n\r\n\'\" LI\")\r\n\r\nmade to recruit students with a background or interest in areas of special need, such as mathematics, science, or language and literacy. The program would require a five-year university course of study leading to the Bachelor\' s degree and would provide a series of paid school year and summer teaching-related internships. Upon entry into the program, optimally with entry into college, students would be given a series of criterion-referenced tests for diag nostic purposes. In conjunction with their regular course load, the students would be enrolled in a series of self-paced tutorials to work on basic skill development in those areas that their diagnostic tests indicated as areas of need. These tutorials would be an integrated part of a substantive undergraduate liberal arts program leading to a sub ject major B.A.or B.S. degree. Upon satisfactory completion of the program and the conferral of the degree, students would be guaranteed admission to participating colleges and universities (in the case of California, the California State University or University of California Graduate School of Education programs), where they would be enrolled as regular students. Gradu ate scholarships covering the full costs of student fees and filing ex penses would be provided to all of these students who enter graduate teacher education programs with an undergraduate grade point aver age of B + or better. Partial tuition scholarships would be available to high-achievement students with a B average. Regular financial aid programs would also be available. Again, as in the first phase of this program, paid internships would be provided to all qualified students for the duration of their postgraduate teacher training studies. During the course of the program, the tutorials would be designed to do away with troublesome conditions such as those identified in Stanley Ivie\' s analysis of Black student achievement on the NTE. Ivie noted that Black students perform poorly on the NTE because the ex amination is as much a reading test as a subject matter test and that many Black students cannot perform well on the test because of poor reading skills. He states that most Black students have not \"mastered the basics\" prior to entering college and that college does little to cor rect the\'situation because of an insufficient emphasis on the teaching of writing and the possibility of students avoiding all liberal arts COurses that have substance or rigor (Ivie, 198 2, p. 171 ). Given such circumstances, it is sadly understandable why tests taken at the end of college too often show poor results. In response to these needs, the developmental programs I am pro-\r\n\r\nposing would focus in the undergraduate level on reading skills, basic mathematics operations-with heavy emphasis on reasoning skills manipulations and application-and good, clear writing. Since the students would at the same time be enrolled in courses that required these skills, they would have sufficient opportunities to practice the skills as they are developing them, while receiving continuous positive feedback as they utilize new skills in their course work. At the end of two years, the students would take a series of tests to measure their growth. A new program, based upon current skill levels, would be developed and the process would be repeated on a higher level. The students also would take practice versions of the required \'teacher li censing exams. The licensing tests themselves should not be used as diagnostic tools. There have been problems in this area in California with the of the CBEST, CBEST. In a report on the use, and potential for misuse, consultant to the California Commission on Richard Watkins, CBEST Teacher Credentialing, cautioned that far greater demands are made on a test to be used for diagnosis than for determining profiCiency, since a diagnostic test must \"yield reliable measurement over a contin uum of skill or ability and provide reliable scores on several reason ably different skills and subskills.\" Watkins concludes that tests such as the CBEST can only make the most general predictions about out comes and cannot be used for prescription on the basis of their results alone (California Post-secondary Education Commission, 1984, p. 7). This explains the lack of success for those who have failed the CBEST and attempt to use their test results as a basis of preparation for reex amination. The candidates who have done this have been frustrated and angered by their lack of progress. The approach recommended above would avoid this frustrating outcome by providing accurate diagnostic tools combined with practice on the actual test to gain fa miliarity and confidence in standardized test taking. As I noted earlier, I strongly urge that the entry tests into a teacher education program not rank-order test takers. The purpose of these tests is to establish the presence or the absence of a prerequisite degree of knowledge and sets of skills. We are not looking for a cutoff point in order to limit entry on the basis of a basic skills examination. The ideal condition would be if almost all of those who sat for basic skills tests were equipped to pass them. The society needs educated people. So far as selection into a teacher training program is concerned, we are bogged down in the issue of pass rates because so many people are not\r\n\r\n(J\'\\ o\r\n\r\npassing, not because these tests are the primary criterion for accept ance into a program. The evidence of basic skills competency is the baseline from which the selection process can proceed. We must create the situation in which we are selecting from among all qualified candi dates in order to identify those who possess the greatest degree of those qualities that make for an outstanding teacher. Given the realities of the present, several things will have to be changed before we can proceed realistically, and only one of them involves raising the competency level of those applying to become teachers. We must acknowledge that if we wish to attract and retain the most qualified, the best applicants, then we have to treat them as young professionals are treated in other career fields. Only then do we have the right to expect high-level professional performance and long range staying power from them. In terms of the minority/low income candidates we need to recruit, this means that we will have to affirm our national commitment to quality education and underwrite, through federal and state contributions, the creating of excellence. This would require incentives to the potential teachers in the form of merit/potential scholarships and loans with forgiveness provisions based upon number of years\' service as a teacher: If we wish to retain good people, we will also have to make serious moves to bring teach ing salaries into the professional range. In California, we have just begun the process. Many hope that it is not too little too late.\r\n\r\nof new teachers should be replaced with ones that encourage person-. nel officials to match the needs of students in the public schools more closely with the talents of potential teachers in the qualified applicant pool. We must always be mindful that the effectiveness of our school systems will not be found in the statistics on the racial composition of our teaching staffs but rather in the statistics reflecting the mastery of ba sic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic by all of our students. We must once and for all understand that proportional minority partici pation in the career of teaching and high-quality outcomes in terms of student learning are not at odds with each other. There is no such thing as a choice between equity and excellence. There is no equity in the absence of excellence. If we are to meet our moral and legal responsibilities to both the potential teachers in our population and to their future students, we must continue to employ valid, job-related written examinations of potential teachers\' basic skills. As we do so, we can make significant advances toward reversing the persistent trends in which teachers with less experience, few advanced degrees, and lower salaries are assigned to schools with high proportions of minority/low-income pupils. As soon as teachers gain enough seniority to do so, they move on to \"better\" schools populated with middle- to high-income students. We must reverse this practice and work on developing systems of equal employment opportunity goals and plans that would integrate school faculties and show all school children that quality education is a func tion of many factors and that achieving high scores on tests is a func tion of many factors as welL but that group membership is no longer one of them.\r\n\r\nStep Two: Placement and retention of teachers from a highly qualified applicant pool\r\nEven given the current condition-that of being at the end of a period of oversupply of teachers-we can look to the future by beginning an implementation process based upon the recommendations in my re port Race, Ethnicity and Equal Employment Opportunity: An Investi gation of Access to Employment and Assignment of Professional Personnel in New York City\'s Public Schools: First, any \"alternative teacher selection processes\" should be termi nated. Though such programs may have been successful in increasing minority employment opportunities, they have operated as racial con duits, steering newly hired minority teachers into almost exclusively minority schools. Then, such old systems for selection and evaluation\r\n\r\nStep Three: Identifying and rewarding outstanding teaching\r\nIn addition to the various kinds of testing programs we have proposed and discussed, I propose an additional one: a test to be taken after at least three years of practice in a full-time public school teaching posi tion. This test would measure not only subject matter competency in a given field, but also: 1) knowledge of learning theory, that is, profes sional judgment as evidenced by ability to diagnose accurately student needs in terms of skill level and social development and select appro-\r\n\r\n-\'--..\r\n\r\n...-< \\0\r\n\r\npriate learning experiences; 2) ability to match instruction, materials and methods to the needs of the students; 3) ability to monitor prog ress of students in a systematic way, providing useful feedback mecha nisms; ability to create well-balanced lessons that vary activities and build progressively from facts to concepts to valuing and evaluating, thus giving students opportunities for and experiences in raising their thinking and reasoning skills; and 4 ) ability to evaluate accurately student progress in a manner that is consistent with stated goals and objectives and that involves students as active participants in the eval uation process. Such a test would be to teaching what the Certified Public Account ant\'s examination is to accounting. As such, it would be entirely vol untary. Only those who wish to take the test for purposes of professional advancement would do so. I would also strongly recom mend that the test be made voluntary on a nationwide basis. This would have the added benefit of opening up the job market for mas ter-level teachers. Outstanding educators who find themselves in a dead-end position in their own school district could seek advancement not only outside their district but also outside their state. Such open competition would work for the benefit of all concerned. Areas expe riencing growth would have an excellent pool from which to select, while teachers who are seeking advancement.in their career goals would not have to leave teaching in order to progress professionally. These master-level teachers would be compensated accordingly, just as CPA-level accountants are. Of course, individual states (and districts) could supplement the na tional examination with locally designed sections, reflecting state con cerns and priorities. For example, a state with a large pupil population whose English skills are limited might want to emphasize the impor tance of teachers being expert in this area, while other states might emphasize other areas of great need. In addition to promoting teacher professionalism by encouraging and rewarding teachers who have objectively demonstrated superior skills as educators, the introduction of a CPA-like examination for teachers would also place teachers (and the polity) in a more strategi cally advantageous position to press colleges and universities to un dertake reforms that would improve the educational enterprise, at all levels. In particular, teachers and policymakers would be in a position to press the higher education establishment to think more systemati cally about the process of teaching (knowledge transmission) and\r\n\r\nlearning (knowledge acquisition) in particular disciplines. Traditionally, disciplinary departments (Le. , physics, English, mathematics, etc.) have not directed much of their resources or ener gies toward understanding how students learn specific subject matter, what difficulties they face in learning how to think abstractly, what preconceptions they bring with them to the classroom, what instruc tional approaches are most effective for particular types of students, and how best to take full advantage of the potential of computer based intelligent tutoring systems. The very promise of a CPA-like exam for teachers, covering what teachers should know about teach ing and learning in particular subject areas, would vastly improve the linkages between teachers in the schools and teachers in colleges and universities. Here again, the AAC report, Integrity in the College Cur riculum, speaks truth to established wisdom:\r\nIf departments, particularly research departments, allocated one or two regular faculty positions to research on learning their discipline, they could produce results which would improve their own teaching effec tiveness ar;;] would have visibility and impact beyond the walls of their own institutions. T hey would influence instructional materials at the secondary as well as the college level. And they could educate young researchers who would continue the enterprise and propagate it to insti tutions where it does not yet exist (p. 16).\r\n\r\nHow Do We Pay for These Programs?\r\nIn addition to the means of support for individuals already men tioned, we could finance these teacher education scholarships and in ternships from at least three possible sources. Since all students benefit from better qualified public school teachers, one appropriate source is a small increase in the registration fees that all university students pay. For example, if the University of California raised student fees by only $25 per semester, it could generate over $7 million per year-enough to support over 900 teacher education students each year. If the State University raised student fees by the same amount, it could generate over $ miiiion per year, enough for over 2,000 teacher candidates. 15 State lotteries are also appropriate sources of funding. In most states with lotteries, by law, lottery profits are supposed to support education. What better use for these monies than to increase the num br of Qualified teachers in our schools? Finally, the legislature could provide the funds through a direct allocation for this program. Frankly, in today\'s fiscal climate, this approach seems to hold the smallest prospect for implementation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWhile we all agree that during the transition period there will be disap pointment for those who fail the tests requested for teacher credential ing, competency examinations for teachers-as long as they are well constructed, correctly standardized measures-are necessary for the development of the teaching profession and beneficial to the education of our young. If we do have a commitment to quality education for all, as part of our dedication to the principles of equality, then we will not change the requirements to fit the present median performance of minority applicants to teacher education programs. Rather, we will keep the desired performance level and provide the kinds of support and training that will make it possible for minority applicants to gar ner the learning and experience needed to pass the examinations for entry into and exit from teaching credential programs. We have the \"know-how\" to do this, all we need now is the affirmation of the belief that we will only have a quality system of education when we can provide equality of outcome in basic skills across economic as well as across racial and ethnic lines. Teaching, the transmission of thought from one mind to another, traditions and values from one generation to the next, is one of the most important activities of the human race. It is the one skill whose absence prevents magnificent successes and guarantees startling fail ures. Without good teaching, genius is struck dumb, poverty is per manent, power is likely to be brutal, and culture doomed to be channeled into mind-forged ruts. Good teaching enables and enno bles, providing society with the tools necessary for self-perpetuation and self-renewal. To put forth the argument that minority youngsters, the most disadvantaged of the poor, and the least able to emancipate themselves from their impoverished surroundings, should be taught by our less-than-best teachers is to pervert the nature of justice. As admirable and important as is the goal of increasing the ranks of mi nority teachers, this objective must not be put before the more funda mental objective of securing good teaching for those who need it the most.

We believe that a crisis exists in ensuring a steady stream of competent and qualified teachers to meet public school needs over the next decade. This crisis is marked by teacher shortages and doubts about the quality of new teachers. We will explain why this crisis exists and will offer some solutions to it, including why we think competen cy testing for entrants into the teaching field is necessary. All indications point to another period of teacher shortages in the 1980s and early 1990s. Shortages have already developed in most areas of the nation in mathematics, science, and special education. The current 16-25 age cohort is one of the smallest in recent times and the pool of college graduates will continue to decrease in coming years. Fewer and fewer college graduates will go into teaching because of the attractiveness of other career fields. The depressed salaries and poor working conditions in\r\n\r\nteaching cannot compete with higher paying jobs in business, industry, and areas of government. There are many reasons why teach ing is not attracting as many people as it once did. The almost total job security it once provided used to attract teachers to the field. This security resulted from a growing teaching force and a demand for teachers that greatly exceeded the supply of available teachers. This is no longer true. Teaching is no longer seen as a secure career field when in many districts teachers with 5, 10, or 15 years experience are laid off. During the Depression and shortly afterward, teaching was one of the few fields that many college educated people aspiring to be professionals could enter. Good job opportunities with chances for career advancement did not exist in many job areas. This was especiall y true for women. This has changed also. While the expanded oppor tunities for women, minorities, and others are a good thing, it is depriving the education field of many exceptional individuals who\r\n\r\nA Ibert Shanker is President of the American Federation of Teachers (since 1974) and Vice-President of the AFL-CIO. Mr. Shanker began his career as a mathematics teacher in the New York City schools. He was elected to the presidency of New York City\'s United Federation of Teachers in 1964 and still holds that office. Mr. Shanker has been active in numerous civic organizations (including the Jewish Labor Com mittee, A. Philip Randolph Insti tute, and League for Industrial Democracy) and advisory groups (including Princeton, Cornell, and International Advisory Council of the Population Institute). He has been a frequent contributor of articles both to national magazines and scholarly journals. 6\r\n\r\nin past decades might have become teachers. The American public should be concerned about where our next generation of teachers will come from. We might be faced with schools with no teachers. How will we respond to a short age of teachers? If teaching posi tions go unfilled, there will be pressures to increase class size, increase teacher loads, and cut the number of programs offered, which will harm educational quality and make schools even less attractive to teachers. Standards at teacher edu cation institutions and standards for entry into the profession might be lowered to increase the supply of certified teachers which again would lower educational quality and weaken public confidence in schools. Teacher shortages also could lead to \"emergency creden tialing\" of individuals who cannot satisfy the normal standards for licensing. While the intent would be to temporarily fill empty class rooms, an understandable clamor for job security by those hired on temporary emergency certificates would ensue. As has happened before, these teachers might be \"grandfathered\" into permanent licensing status. Also, there might well be a period of conflict over changing structures in education. Differential staffing arrangements and merit pay plans might be proposed, not on any claim of educational merit, but because they would be expedient. Closely related to all this is the question of the caliber of students attracted to teacher education pro grams. Recent studies indicate that teacher education students rank below other college students on average Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores. For example, the January 2 1, 1982, Washington Post reported the results of a study conducted by the Virginia Council of Higher Education which showed that education majors at Virginia\'s\r\n\r\nEducational Measurement\r\n\r\nTesting: A Natural Affinity\r\n\r\nstate universities scored an average of 121 points lower on the SAT than did those who received bachelor\'s degrees in other fields. At Virginia private colleges, education majors scored an average of 80 points below other graduates. While we are on the verge of a major teacher short age, the quality of candidates for collegiate teacher preparation pro grams is low. Because the two phenomena work in concert, we will face a major crisis in education. Former U.S. Commissioner of Education Ernest Boyer remarked that \"The teaching profession is caught in a vicious cycle, spiraling downward.. . . Rewards are few, morale is low, the best teachers are bailing out and the supply of good recruits is drying up\" (Education Daily, January 2 1, 1982). Boyer highlights major probJems that must be addressed. Boston University education pro fessor W. Timothy Weaver ( 1979) studied this problem also. He looked at three conditions he pre sumes to be interrelated: a decline in the job market for teachers, a shift in student preferences away from the field of education, and a sharp decline in test scores of students intending to study education. As a result, Weaver sees those with low test scores go on to become graduat ing seniors who then go on to become teachers. It is particularl y devastating to note that in a com parison of the National Longitudi nal Study of the class of 1976, Weaver found that teacher educa tion majors who did not go into teaching scored higher on four out of five competence measures in the areas of mathematics, reading, and vocabulary than those who found teaching jobs. In its intermediate projections, the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics ( 1980) reports that the total demand for additional certi fied teachers between 1984 and 1988 will be 745,000.\r\n\r\nWhile similar projections for teacher supply indicate that the number of new teacher graduates will equal or slightly exceed the demand, a number of critical ques tions arise:\r\nâˆ‘ How many of those new gradu ates will be attracted to public school teaching? âˆ‘ How qualified will those new teachers be? âˆ‘ How can we assure that only well-qualified individuals enter teaching?\r\n\r\nUntil we adequately answer these questions as a matter of public policy, the crisis will remain. Boyer proposes a three-part solu tion. He advocates that teacher education colleges tighten their admission standards, that they require seniors to pass competency tests before graduating, and that states award scholarships to prom ising teacher recruits. Weaver, on the other hand, concludes that schools of education must sever their close connection with the public schools and broaden their mission to recognize the need for education professionals in business, government, and other areas. He feels that this would attract better qualified students to schools of education. While these approaches address part of the problem, neither, in our\r\n\r\nopinion, provides a comprehensive solution to problems of providing an adequate number of qualified teachers. We will offer some thoughts on how this situation might be remedied. Money is one critical factor. If teaching paid a salary comparable to that of other occupations requir ing similar preparation, there might not be a shortage of highly -qualified people to go into teaching and remain in teaching. This would alleviate the shortage. In the fall of 1982, the typical beginning teacher with a bachelor\'s degree will earn a salary in the $12-$14,000 range. According to a recent report (Endi cott & Lindquist, 1981), 1982 bache lor degree graduates can expect a starting salary of $25,428 in engi neering, $18,648 in accounting, $21,5 16 in mathematics and statis tics, $22,260 in computer science, and $17,448 in business administra tion. If teaching salaries started at $25,000 per year, there probably would be more highly qualified college students attracted to teach ing. While $25,000 per year may be a goal we must pursue, it is not realistic for the near future. The monetary incentive, however, re mains a real problem so long as teaching does not compete with other professions. There are, of course, other reasons why teaching is not attractive to many people but\r\n\r\nJames Gordon Ward is Director of Research for the American Federation of Teachers. He holds three degrees from the State Univer sity of New York at Albany, was a secondary school history and Eng lish teacher in New York State, and worked in the field of education policy with the New York State United Teachers, the state AFT affiliate in New York. His areas of specialization are education policy; public finance, budgeting, and financial management; and educa tion finance.\r\n\r\nSummer 1982\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n>,\r\n\r\nwithout adequate compensation, rectifying the other problems is impossible. With adequate salaries, the other problems have a chance of being improved. Teaching is a difficult job requir ing a complex set of knowledges and skills. According to Bartlett Giamatti (1980), president of Yale University,\r\nA liberal education is at the heart of a civil society, and at the heart of a liberal education is the act of teaching .... The teacher chooses. The teacher chooses how to struc ture choice. The teacher\'s power and responsibility lie in choosing where everyone will begin and how, from that beginning, the end will be shaped. The choice of that final form lies in the teacher\'s initial act.... Somehow the line between encouraging a design and imposing a specific stamp must be found and clarified. That is where the teacher first begins to choose. (p. 24)\r\n\r\nThis definition of a teacher imposes awesome responsibility on those who choose to teach. It describes a person with a deep knowledge of learners and their ways, high-level skills in the science âˆ‘of pedagogy, and a mastery of the subject being taught. A teacher is also a decisionmaker. We in the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have very definite ideas about how we can ensure that the teachers our institutions of higher education produce are com petent. We also think it is perfectly appropriate and desirable to test new entrants in the teaching field to ensure that they meet minimum standards. As opposed to the leaders of the National Education Associa tiort (NEA), who hold that such tests are irrelevant and point the finger of blame everywhere but at themselves, the AFT welcomes fair and valid teacher competency tests. However, testing alone cannot produce competent teachers, teachers who in Giamatti\'s words can \"choose how to structure choice.\" Also, we do not accept the frequent argument that we do not need to test college graduates be cause they have already satisfied the graduation requirements of the college. Colleges have different programs and different standards. A test would be valuable in ensuring that general standards are met. This\r\n8\r\n\r\nwas, and remains, the purpose for tests such as the bar examination for lawyers or the CPA exams for public accountants. The public must be confident that lawyers, accountants, and teachers meet certain minimal standards. Tests are less subjective than measures such as personal interviews or examinations of anecdotal records. Tests should be viewed as a positive means to support standards. Teach ing deserves top-notch college students who will be able to moti vate and guide their students. Bright and able college students interested in teaching should be encouraged to enter teacher educa tion programs. The job of teaching, however, must be enriched so thatit will be attractive to the well rounded individual desiring to teach. If you do not know something, you cannot teach something. Teacher education students need a broad collegiate program in the arts and humanities, the social sciences, the natural and behavioral sciences, the pure and applied mathematics, and the subject(s) they are going to teach. A rigorous and demanding undergraduate program can pro duce this, and testing to ensure that the candidate has attained this knowledge can be an important milestone in the preparation of a teacher. The prospective teacher also needs specialization in a subject area. The undergraduate program should require that the student complete the requirements for a full major course of study in a subject. A history teacher should not be an education major with a brief back ground in history, but should have the skills and knowledge to teach history. Preparation in the area of specialization can be tested also. A rigorous program at the under graduate level in the arts and sciences and in a substantive spe cialization can help attract those students who are interested in teaching, but who find many current programs to be intellectual ly flabby. There is also substantive techni cal knowledge that goes into the making of a teacher. The prospec tive teacher needs professional or pedagogical training in develop mental and social psychology; the history, philosophy, and sociology\r\n\r\nof education; diagnostic, planning, and prescriptive techniques; meth ods of instruction and classroom management techniques; tech niques of research and evaluation; curriculum development; and teaching special needs students. Testing of teacher education stu dents is appropriate in all these areas. Prospective teachers also need practical classroom experience be fore they are certified. Testing plays a part here because this experience must be evaluated continually and formatively so that the teacher candidate can most efficiently use this period as a learning experience. AFT\'s policy is that this practicum should take the form of a 2- to 3-year internshipâˆ‘ in which the intern would not have a full teaching load and would be paid a negotiated base salary. It must be stressed that the internship is a final and important qualifying step. This test differs from the others we have discussed because it is based on actual perfor mance as a teacher, rather than on acquisition of knowledge. None theless, it is a critical assessment point in preparing a new teacher for the classroom. AFT\'s policy in this area calls for greater involvement by classroom teachers and teacher educators in setting and maintaining the stan dards for teaching. Specifically, AFT advocates a series of written examinations to test fundamental knowledge in language and compu tational skills, knowledge in gener al education and the subject area to be taught, and knowledge of peda gogy. These would be part of an extended licensure period and suc cessful completion of these tests would be required before beginning the internship. On completion of the internship, permanent certifi cation or licensure would be grant ed. In developing such a testing pro gram, it is important that teachers, school administrators, school boards, civil rights groups, com munity representatives, and others have the opportunity to comment on and suggest improvements in the tests. Such input will improve the quality of the program and increase its acceptance. To avoid any misunderstanding, while we strongly advocate the use of tests in the manner we described, a test should never be the only Edllcational l\\Ieasurement\r\n\r\ncriterion used to evaluate the com petence of a teacher preparation candidate. Other criteria also must be employed, but even a single test can provide valuable information that can improve both the assess ment process and the end product. The test is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for entry into the profession. This idea is not that radical. Why not require entry tests universally for new teachers? We require physi cians, attorneys, public accoun tants, and others to pass exams before they are licensed to practice their profession. Maybe it is time we do the same for teachers. Those who oppose this idea, including some teachers and some teacher organizations, argue that passing a test does not guarantee a good teacher, because a test or series of tests cannot measure the complex set of abilities that go into making a good teacher. This is true, but it misses the point. If a student preparing to be a teacher cannot pass a test or series of tests, then that student should not be allowed to become a teacher until the deficien cies are corrected. The NEA in its Resolution C-2, first passed in 1969, stated its opposition to testing for teacher competence by saying that \"examinations such as the National Teacher Examinations must not be used as a condition of employment, evaluation, criterion for certifica tion, placement, or promotion of teachers. The Association is con vinced that no test in existence is satisfactory for such usage.\" NEA Executive Director Terry Herndon said that the Educational Testing Service, which makes the National Teacher Examinations, \"reminds me somewhat of armament manu facturers, who say guns don\'t kill people, people do\" (NEA NOW, November 19, 1979). In 1972, NEA called for the abolition of the National Teacher Examinations. We believe this is a destructive stance and respond by pointing out that all other abilities are superflu ous if a math teacher cannot pass an exam in mathematics, or if an elementary teacher does not satisfy requirements of basic literacy, or if a teacher of the mentally handi capped cannot successfully com plete a test in psychology. Naturally the question arises of testing veteran teachers. Just as Summer 1982\r\n\r\nnaturally, teachers resist and will continue to resist until other veter an professionals are also retested periodically. On close examination, the entire notion applied to veteran teachers does not make sense. Testing for new teachers is a screening device to keep those wi th obvious deficiencies out of the profession. Mechanisms already exist to remove veteran teachers with similar deficiencies. During the teacher\'s probationary period, deficiencies can be identified and corrected by principals or other supervisors through the teacher evaluation system. An incompetent teacher who cannot correct his or her deficiencies can be terminated during the probationary period. Even after a teacher receives tenure, a competent supervisor can remove a teacher through a due process hearing procedure, if the supervisor can prove the case. Tenure only serves to provide an impartial process for evaluating teacher per formance and removing those who are incompetent. Under these cir cumstances, to retest all veteran teachers on a periodic basis would be extremely costly, time.con suming, and ultimately wasteful. Millions of dollars would be spent on a new procedure, while existing procedures of teacher evaluation and dismissal for just cause are absolutely adequate. Retesting all veteran teachers would be throwing tax dollars away. Another issue that must be ad dressed is the differential racial impact of testing. Experience with the National Teacher Examina tions in several states has shown that black teacher candidates are more likely to fail the test than are white teacher candidates. The real problem is the lack of resources and attention devoted to black schools in many parts of the country. The race differential has been declining in recent years because of the positive impact of the civil rights movement and the heightened sensitivity to the problem. Rather than simplistically brand a test as racist, we must strike at the root of the problem. We do not want to certify teachers who cannot satisfy minimum standards. We do want to improve the education of minorities and take affirmative action to provide blacks and other minorities with the opportunity to succeed in\r\n\r\nteacher education programs and to become good teachers. This re quires a positive program that will actively encourage minority college students to pursue careers in teach ing. The issue comes down to answer ing some very fundamental ques tions, which should help frame the discussion and further explain our position. Does the public have the right to insist on minimum standards of teacher competence? Of course, the public has this right. As in any professional area where the states license individuals to practice, the public can and should insist that prospective teachers meet, and prove they can meet, certain min imum standards. We have already suggested what we think the min imum standards should be. Can tests be appropriate mea sures of teacher competence? Tests cannot measure everything well. However, tests can adequately and validly measure basic skill acquisi tions, knowledge of general educa tion and specific content areas, and knowledge of pedagogy. Skill areas can best be assessed by evaluating performance, but competence in knowledge areas is fundamental. Other qualities hardly matter if a person preparing to teach does not satisfy minimum competency re quirements in the areas described. Are tests of teacher competency the only key to reform? Teacher competency tests for new teachers are only one of the methods we can use to improve the quality of our teachers. Stronger academic pro grams for teacher education stu dents, better admission decisions for entry into those programs, and realistic internship programs are other methods. Employing them together will go a long way toward solving the problem. While these ideas may help solve the problems of teacher competen cy, how will they alleviate teacher shortages? Teacher shortages will continue to be a problem, but if we react by lowering standards and putting substandard teachers in classrooms, we will only lower quality in the schools and under mine the public\'s confidence in public education. One solution, as we discussed above, is to make Continued on page 26 9\r\n\r\n\\.\r\n\r\n-,\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\nHODGKINS & MCKENNA Continued from page 12 on standard entrance examinations. Second, there is little or no evidence that the highest scoring students on standardized measurement are des tined to become outstanding teachers. Whatever the current situation with achievement levels of candi dates for teacher preparation, teachers want candidates to begin that preparation with the highest possible promise of becoming strong and effective professionals. But entrance examinations admin istered by education departments are not likely to provide the solu tion to this problem either. This is particularly so if such examinations are of the typical basic-skills and general education achievement types. The same reasons apply for rejecting tests for admission to preparation as those cited earlier for not using exit examinations: They represent a redundancy and waste of resources because certification of competence to enter professional schools should be by the depart ments and professors who have provided the prerequisite instruc tion. In addition, entry to preprofes sional and professional preparation should be based on a wide range of factors-interest, motivation, com mitment, and experience and suc cess in related areas and the like. Basic skills and knowledge achieve ment should be only one of a number of factors to be taken into account when such decisions are made. What Are the Alternatives? A first-level solution to the issues of entry to preparation for teaching might well be like that recom mended for exit examinations: Influence the appropriate adminis ,trative, policy, and political pro cesses to require departments in universities that teach basic skills, liberal arts, and the teaching spe cialties, to assure that their passing grades firmly and accurately indi cate competence. As an interim measure only, the academic departments that teach the content of the first 2 years of college should b urged to imple ment several basic skills and/or general education and teaching26\r\n\r\nspecialty proficiency examinations (criterion-referenced, written, oral, performance) no later than the end of the sophomore year. Passing these would be required to proceed to more advanced studies. Finally, education departments should be required to demonstrate, both for state approval and for national accreditation (through approval by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education) that they implement and enforce a range of criteria for admission to preparation including grade point averages, recommenda tions of previous instructors, work samples, evaluations of experiential learning (particularly with children and youth) and other evidence of interest, commitment, and motiva tion. One promising move in this direction is a proposal under con sideration by the Standards Com mittee of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Educa tion to include in the Council\'s standards a specific grade-point requirement for admission to pro grams of teacher preparation. Conclusion We reicerate our major premises:\r\nâˆ‘ The\'united teaching profession seeks more and stronger assessment for determining who shall be permitted to pursue teacher prepa ration programs and for evaluating successful completion of the pro grams. âˆ‘ No existing written assessment is accurate enough for making such determinations.\r\n\r\nSHANKER & WARD Continued from page 9 teacher salaries and working condi tions comparable to those in other professions so that teaching can compete in attracting bright and able college students. Although we believe this should be done, we do not believe it will be done in the current economic and social cli mate. Another potential solution is to reexamine the structure of public ,schools. There may well be innovative approaches to staffing which would allow highly qualified, experienced teachers to work wi th an instructional staff of certified individuals with varying back grounds, preparations, competen cies, and roles. We think this might be an answer to shortages of compe tent teachers and is an idea worth exploring. There is no doubt that the debate about testing beginning teachers will go on for some time. It simply makes sense to test knowledge in basic skills, subject area, and teach ing methodology, among other areas, to make sure that prospective teachers are not deficient in these areas. Why not start out right instead of complaining later about teacher incompetence?\r\nReferences Endicott, F. S., & Lindquist, V. R. The Endicott Report 1982.

The research will seek to ascertain how the use of testing as a state certification requirement changes state and local actions regarding teacher selection and preparation. We expect to see changes in teacher selection and preparation decisions on the part of state and local education agencies, s chools of edu cation, accreditation agenCies, and state standard-setting agencies. By surveying schools of education and local school districts in five states that currently use the NTE or state-developed tests for teacher certification, we will seek to dis cover how this state mandate a f fects the characteristics of the prospective teaching force, the curriculum in schools of education, and the supply of candidates to individual school districts. Interviews with state- level policymakers, accredi tation and\" certi fication agency of ficials, and deans of teacher education programs will investigate how a standard that is set by the state affects decision criteria and the balance of control among these 1nstitutions\r\n_.\r\n\r\nStatement of the Problem Over the past decade, a variety of state initiatives have attempted to improve the quality of education which school districts deliver . . These initiatives have ranged from school accountability legislation to minimal competency testing and, recently, increased course requi rements for students. These state-level actions, however, have not confrontd the central problem in the delivery of educational services--the quality of teaching in our schools and c lassrooms. One important aspect of this prob lem is the quality of teachers attracted and admitted to the occupation. Teaching was once a relatively attractive occupation drawing to it white men who valued security, talented women who had few other career options, and professionally-oriented black men and women who were barred from other fields. While teaching ay never have attracted  most academically able of young people, some recent studies have found that tne academic ability of new entrants is dec lining (Weaver, 1979; Vance and S chlecty, 1982). There are many explanations for this trend. Declining school enrOllments created a surplus of teachers, thus discouraging new entrants. New career opportunities began to open to The low public image of teaching and declining all social groups. teachers\' salaries (in real terms) combined to discourage talented young people from conSidering teaching. \'\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n- 2 -\r\n\r\nState governments have begun to be concerned about the ability of The concern is a natural one, for states new entrants into teaching. have a long-established role in controlling ac cess to teaching since individual school districts have di fficulty forcing change in teacher preparation practices. In this area, as in most others, states can draw upon only a limited repertoire of policy tools to achieve their ends. Teacher preparation occurs in schools of education that are not directly under the control of state officials. Accrediting associations serve as generally weak controls over the content and quality of education offered in these schools. And hiring decisions are made by local boards of edUCation. Thus, to affect the quality of new entrants to teaching, states must use tools that influence the decisions of schools of education, school systems, or individual teacher candidates. States may increase funds to school districts for upgrading salaries or funds to s chools of education for improving teacher training. They may regulate school districts or schools of edu cation by imposing program approval or certification standards. Each of these policy tools is intended to constrain or determine decisions by other educational organizations. Each is based upon a number of assumptions and theories about organizational and individual behav ior and about the process of education. Recently  a growing number of states have turned to tests as a meanS of selecting pre-service teacher candidates. In 1 97 7 , at least 23 states were USing the National Teacher Examinations (NTE) for purposes ranging from obtaining statewide data t9 validating credits earned at non-accredited institutions. Ey 1 9 80 , at least seven states were using the NTE for certification purposes (Lewis, 1 97 9; Vlaanderen, 1 980 ) . Some states have developed their own tests of teacher competency for certi fication, while others are currently considering licensing teachers based in part on statewide examinations prior to certi fication (Southern Regional Education Eoard, 1 97 9; M cNeil, 1 9 81 ; Killian, Wood, and Eell, 1 9 80)\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nTeacher competency testing is one outcome of a growing frustration with efforts to change the character of teacher education. As a .senior member of the education establishment recently proc laimed on the cover of ihi Delta Kappan magazine, Let\' s face it: Colleges of pedagogy will in all probability never overhaul their programs i f each college is to do it alone. There are too many hurdles, too much disparity among institutions, too much institut ional jealousy, too much divisiveness and lethargy among faculties, too much fear, and too much ineptness in the leadership. It is likely, of course, that one or two institutions will blaze a new path. But will others follow\'? Well, maybe. We won\' t know until It is more probable, however, some college really does it. that only forces broader and more powerful than those of a single college can ever break through these barriers and\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n_.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n----- ------ -----\'\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n, I\r\n\r\n- 3 -\r\n\r\nrestraints to bring about a new day in pedagogical education. These forces will be political as well as professional, external to col leges and universities, and guided by a new coalition of professional and lay organizations and their leaders. (Smith, 1980) State-level policymakers, concerned with what they regard as inadequate teacher preparation, have begun to impose the NTE and other tests as a condition of teacher certi fication. At least two states (Florida and Alabama) have made the continued approval of a school of education contingent upon the percentage of the school\' s graduates passing the statewide test. These policymakers have apparently despaired of improving the quality of schools of education through trad itional means. They do not trust schools of education to graduate only those teacher candidates who are fit to teach. They do not trust the natioP1 ac creditation process to upgrade the quality of teacher education nor do they trust their own program approval processes. They view teacher. competency testing as an instrument to prevent those unfit to teach from teaching. At the same time, it is a mechanism for exerting pressure on schools of education. After all, The idea of making teachers pass a test has popular appeal. no lawyer, doctor, or accountant can become a member of the profession without passing an examination. Indeed, 85 percent of citizens answering the Gallup Poll in 1979 agreed that teachers should be requi red to pass a stat\\ board examination and then t ested periodically to keep up to date with their field (Cronin, 1983). The idea of a test, in .general, and the NTE, in particular, has substantial ap peal:\r\n1.\r\n\r\nIt is objective, thus removing discretionary decisions from both the state bureaucracy and the education establishment, particularly the providers of teacher training. It is clear-cut. Unlike the standards involved in accreditation, which are vague, and unlike competency-based teacher certi fication, which is cumbersome, it yields a score. It is not costly, at least not costly to the state. No infusions of capital into teacher training are required. The minor costs (test fees) are borne by the teacher candidates as well as the major costs (the cancellation of one\' s career plans after four years of college) . It is symbolically important. In a tangible way, it demonstrates that the state is attending to the problem of low teacher qual ity\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n--------_-_-- .. .-...-.....- .r ....-.......... .. - \"\"\'-... .... .\"\"!..... _!II:lID _... ep4f\':\' .........,; \'t9P .\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n- \'4 -\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nIt is measurable. It permits the state to assess and describe the performance of schools of education and c lasses of teacher candida tes. It can be said to be unintrusive. The state can claim that it is not prescribing the behavior of schools of education, school districts, or teacher candidates. More direct regulatory moves m ight be reSisted on the grounds of \"academic freedom, \" \" local control,\" or \"institutional autonomy. \" The requirement has face validity and surface plausibility. Few will object to teachers being required to demonstrate what they are expected to know. The idea that such know ledge is \"necessary if not suf fficient\" is very persuasive. Finally, in the case of the NTE, the test has been sanctioned both by the most prestigious testing organization in the nation and by a board of experts who advise that organization on the NTE.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nThe choice of this policy tool by state governments is important for several reasons. First, the decision to use a statewide test with a . standardized cutof f score for certification affects teacher supply across the state. This policy may support or complicate a local district\' s hiring task by helping to screen potential applicants, on the one hand, or by preventing access to the profession for some potential teachers whom districts m ight want to hire, on the other. Tighter state standards for certi fication shifts procedural control over teacher selection away from local school districts and, perhaps, away from school of education accreditation agencies as well. This governance change may standardize teacher preparation and selection practices ( for be tter or worse) or it may have little immediate ef fect on these practices. In either case, there are likely to be a number of second-order consequences. State standard-setting alters the distribution of power and responsibility over decisiormaking by applying a new criterion that constrains or determines the actions of lower level policymakers. The new patterns of influence that emerge from such a policy generally affect other policy decisions as well by strengthening the capacities of some institutions while weakening those of others. Finally, the use of teacher competency tests for certification means that substantive control of entry into the teaching profession is, in a sense, removed from members of the profession, schools of education, school districts, and state governments alike. Although state officials may confer with teacher representatives or school of educa tion heads to set cutof f scores, the know ledge expected of teacher candidates is determined by the Educational Testing Service (in the case The assumptions underlying the of the NTE) or other test developers. test- making process about epucational theory, practice, and the relation between theory and practice become standards for entry. These\r\n\r\n\'.\r\n\r\n- 5 standards, unlike those of other professions, are not set by practitioners. They may or may not be consistent with other standards set by state policymakers through the program approval or certi fication processes. The lack of involvement in substantive standard-setting of these actors may, on the one hand, depoliticize the teacher selection process and thereby add credibility to the outcomes of the process. On the other hand, it may produce outcomes that are at variance with other state or local goals for education or for the composition of the teaching force. Contribution of the Research This study will add to our understanding of the ef fects on educational institutions (s chools of education and school districts) of state-level standard-setting in the area of teacher certi fication. It will examine how teacher competency tests for certi fication.influence teacher preparation in schools of edu cation, selection of teacher candida tes by schools of education and schoof districts, and the supJjly of teachers to school districts. The study will also explore the interactions between certification standards and other state policies governing teacher preparation and selection (e.g., state approval of -teacher education. programs and state requirements af fecting the training and compc.âˆ‘sition of the teaching force, such as school district course offerings which teachers must be prepared to teach) . Despite the potentially dramatic effects of teacher competency testing on teacher supply and on the quality and composition of the teaching force, no study of this kind has yet been undertaken. Most of the reporting on this topic has appeared in the popular press. Individual states have conducted validation studies for some of the tests, and tabulations of pass/fail rates have been prepared. The Southern Regional Education Board is currently preparing a report on teacher competency testing (to be completed in June 1983 ) that will discuss failure rates and validity questions; however, a systematic investigation of ef fects on schools of education and s chool districts is beyond the scope of their report.[1] Our study wil l fill a gap in the current knowledge base concerning the intended and unintended ef fects of this state policy tool for upgrading teacher quality. The study is especially important and timely as increasing numbers of states are considering the introduction of teacher competency testing.\r\n\r\n[1] Also, William Harris of the Educational Testing Service, who is responsible for administration of the NTE, reported in a recent telephone conversation that he knew of no major studies of the effects of the NTE currently being conducted.\r\n\r\n\", I\r\n\r\n- 6 -\r\n\r\nResearch Questions The study will be guided by t wo main research questions:\r\n1.\r\n\r\nHow has teacher competency testing affected teacher preparation?\r\n\r\nHow has teacher competency testing af fected the supply of teachers to school districts? The answer to each of these questions requires two levels of evidence: evidence of changes in preparation or supply and evidence that illuminates the reasons or mediating factors for these outcomes.\r\n2.\r\n\r\nWith respect to teacher preparation, we will examine changes in admission standards, curriculum, counselling, retention and graduation standards. We will as certain whether school of education decisionmakers attribute these changes to teacher competency testing or to other factors, and whether the changes have resulted from internal or external evaluation of the programs. We will examine how teacher competency test results are used by s chool of education deans and officials of accrediting or approval agencies to make decisions about program content, standards, or requirements.\r\nOur investigation of teacher supply to school districts will inc lude evidence about the supply of different types of teachers (by subject matter certi fication, educational background, race, etc.) to school districts with different supply and demand characteristics (e.g., location, size of district, labor market characteristics, enrollment trends). We will ascertain whether school district decisionmakers attribute suPply. effects and perceptions of applicant quality to the existence of the competency tests or to other fact ors, and whether perceived ef fects have triggered other changes in their selection processes.\r\n\r\nIn the next sections of this proposal, we present our conceptual framework for examining these questions and a dis cussion of our proposed methodology.\r\n\r\nCONCEPTUAL FRAiORK\r\nOur goal is to examine the effects of state-mandated use of teacher competency tests for teacher certification on teacher preparation and supply. The effects on teacher preparation and supply are mediated, of course, by s chools of education and they are mani fest in school districts. In order to understand these effects, we must take into account the broader context in which the tests operate. This context, the speci fics of which will vary from state to state, are described with reference to Figure 1.\r\n\r\nThe process begins with the college and career planning o f an age cohort of young people intending to attend college. They move through a stream of personal decisions and institutional selection decisions which\r\n\r\nExogenous\r\n\r\nFactors\r\n\r\nEndogenous Factors\r\n\r\n.\'\r\n\r\nr Size\r\nL\r\n\r\nof K-l2 population\r\n\r\n>\r\n- I -\r\n\r\n(\r\n-\r\n\r\nSize and scope of educatioal programs (K-l2)\r\n...\r\n-\r\n\r\nConditions and policies affecting college attendance Size of college-age cohort Occupational opportunity structure\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nSupply of potential teacher candidates\r\n\"\r\n\r\nPerceived attractiveness of \'teaching (salaries, working conditions, etc.)\r\n\r\nControl Accreditation Program approval\r\nI \'V\r\n\r\nState Policies\r\n.(;\r\n-;\r\n\r\nTeacher Preparation\r\n.....\r\n\r\nAdmissions standards Curriculum/grading procedures Counselling and retention standards Graduation requirements\r\n\r\nI\r\n......\r\n\r\n. \r\n\r\nStandards Financing Regulations .

These personal and institutional decisions are af fected by a set of exogenous factors and The exogenous factors are those over which state e ndogenous factors. educational policymakers have no control. The endogenous factors are those which are or could be affected by state-level policymakers. The first determinant of the supply of teacher candidates is the size of an age cohort potentially available to be come teachers. Nationwide the size of the pool of 18 to 21 year olds has ranged from 14. 7 mil lion in 1970 to 17.1 million in 1980 to a projected 14.6 mil lion in 1989. Consequently, we can antiCipate some decline in supply due to a shrinking supply of eligibles. The size of the potential pool is further determined by the percentage of the cohort attending college. The second determinant of the supply of teacher candidates is the anti cipated demand for teachers. The school-age population has shrunk from 5 2.6 million in 1970 to 45 .9 million in 1980; by 1989, the projected population will have decreased to 33 million (U. S. Department of Commerce, Current Population Reports). Thus, nationwide we may expect a decrease in over-all demand for teachers, assuming that the teacher-student ratio remains roughly constant. Demand af fects supply in two ways: (1) by influencing students\' career decisions based on their assessed probabilities of getting a job, and (2) by affecting wage rates (one element of the attractiveness of a profession to academical ly . talented candidates). The third determinant of the supply of teacher candidates is the This variable is a complex perceived attractiveness of teaching. function of salary and other factors. In real terms, average teacher salary has declined from $6, 8 21 in 1966-67 t o $6, 769 in 1982-83 (National Education AssOCiation, 1982-83) . The decline has, of course, occurred during a decade of teacher surplus. Other factors which af fect the attractiveness of teaching range from career alternatives available to prospectiveâˆ‘ teachers to class size to the esteem with which teachers are viewed. The latter may be af fected, in the long run, by how easy or hard it is to become a teacher. In a general way, these factors determine the supply of potential teacher candidates. A varie of external policies also af fect the supply of and demand for teachers. The availability of student aid increases the supply of college graduates. Since a large fraction of college graduates are potential teachers (Vance and Schlecty, 1982), the more student aid is available, the greater the supply of teacher candidates. Federal programs have been used to prepare teachers in vocational, career, bilingual, special, and reading education, while categorical programs for students have created a demand for particular types of teachers. The National Defense Educa t{on Act of , 95 8 deliberately set out to increase the suPply of SCience, mathematics, and foreign language teachers. Some legislation has indirect e f fects. One of the most important pieces of legislation to increase the supply of teachers was the provision granting exemption from the military draft to young men who were teachers. Other legislation has a symbolic effect. Modest\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n- 9 categorical programs (e.g., energy education\" environmental education) probably signal an emerging need and thus induce some young people to prepare to teach in these areas. Judicial rulings, federal and state, may increase demand for personnel. Early court rulings mandating the provision of education to handicapped students began to create demand for special education teachers. Court orders mandating desegregated faculties may create demand for m inority personnel. Court orders mandating school finance reform may increase the discretionary revenue to some school districts, thus increasing the demand for teachers.\r\n,\r\n\r\nState legislation can have a dramatic ef fect on the demand for teachers. In the first place, state aid legislation helps to determine overall budget; since 70-80 percent of school budgets are personnel costs, the overall budget shapes the potential size of teacher demand. Legislation that mandates specific subject-matter requirements creates demand. Legislation that regulates class size or teacher-pupil ratio hapes demand. On the other hand, legislation which increases or decreases the ease of certi fication strongly af fects supply. All of these supply and demand factors influence the number and type of students entering the teacher education process. Although not shown on the figure, there are several selection decisions. These are ad m ission to college, to teacher preparation, to student teaching, and the recommendation for initial certi fication (Schalock, 1979, p. 364 ) . While these decisions af fect supply, presumably decreasing it at each stage, other forces are endeavoring to increase the quality of the prospective teachers. The teacher education program is af fected by several agencies whose function it is to control program quality. The college or university of which the teacher education program is a part is subject to the regional accreditation process. If the teacher education program participates in NCATE review, as do about 4 0 to 5 0 percent, it must meet a number of additional standards. Most states operate a program approval process which requires teacher education programs to meet state standards. Teacher education programs are also influenced to conform to regulations which control the content of school district curricula because they must prepare teachers to teach required courses or mandated programs. The graduates of teacher education programs then meet the states! standards for certification and licensing. In this study, we will examine how teacher competency tests for certification affect schools of eduation by virtue of their presece as an additional standard and/or by their ef fects on the program approval or accreditation processes. The tests directly increase the standards for individual certi fication. In addition, however, they may also affect the other quality control mechanisms which, in turn, will affect schools of education and s chool districts. Thus, for example, performance on the test may become one of the criteria which is examined by NCATE or by the program approval process.\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\n- 10 As will be descr\'ibed in substantial detail below, we will exam ine the direct and indirect effects of teacher competency tests upon the practices of schools of education. We will ascertain ef fects upon admission standards, curriculum, and graduation standards. We will attempt to discover effects upon supply and upon quality as measured by _the tests and as perceived by teacher edu cators and employers. We will examine the direct and indirect effects of the NTE upon school districts. We will ascertain effects upon teacher supply (e.g., in various fields) , upon teacher quality (as perceived by directors of personnel) , and upon the mix of teachers (e.g., race) . These effects may vary for school districts of different types. Demographic and locational factors make some districts more attractive to teachers. Salary, working conditions, and the ability of district management will ameliorate or exacerbate problems associated with recruitment. Finally, the state can af fect the hiring ability of local districts not only by controlling teacher quality and supply but by directly affecting locally available finances and working conditions. Finally, there may be effects of competency tests on the , perceived attractiveness of teaching. By altering the pub lic image of teaching and by decreasing teacher supply, the tests may lead to increases in salaries or other attractions to teaching. Because the tests may introdu ce greater selectivity in entry to the occupation of teaching, the pub lic, and in turn, prospective teacher candidates may perceive an increase in the attractiveness of teaching. This could increase the supply of (high quality) teachers. Because the use of tests\' as a certi fication device is fairly recent, this effect may be barely percepti ble by the time of the st,udy and we do not expect to be able to track it within the time and resources of the study.\r\nEffects of Teacher Competency Testing\r\n\r\nThe NTE and other state-developed tests of teacher competency comprise only one element of an array of state policies designed to upgrade teacher quality. Many states have tried to influence the quality of the teaching force by upgrading standards for admission to teacher edu cation institutions, by changing course requirements for graduation, and by changing the requirements for continuing certification as well. As Table 1 indicates, states have instituted tests for admission to schools of education, lengthened the term of student teaching, added internships, and/or required performance assessments prior to permanent certification in addition to testing for in1 tial certi fication.\r\nAll of these actions variously affect the supply of teacher candidates and the character of teacher preparation. We will endeavor to sort out the differential and convergent effects of these policies. It is already clear, however, that the competency tests themselves are having important effects.\r\n\r\n:\'-J\"Wf\'.. .. ;u:c... i\r\n\r\nsaâ€¢JWW51UI\"\"\"\" .âˆ‘ \",,\",, \r\n\r\nAt=--==c=\r\n\r\n. _____ ... ..... ___________________ _\r\n\r\n-\'---______\"_._ .._...

In 1 982, 83 percent of Florida\'s prospective teachers passed the state\'s criterion-referenced test for certi fication; only 3 5 percent of black applicants passed the test (Toch, 1 983 ) . Sixty-six percent of Louisiana\'s 1 978 teaching candidates passed the NTE; however, only 4 percent of applicants from black pubic colleges and 26 percent from black private institutions passed the test (SREB, 1979) . When South Carolina raised the NTE cutof f score, in the late 1970s, about half of the state\'s graduates failed the test. At some b lack colleges, the failure rate reached 1 00 percent (SREB, 1979) . Recent statistics on Alabama\'s and Arizona\'s state-developed tests show similar patterns. Failure rates on the Alabama tests for different f ields of certification range from 7 to 28 percent for white candidates, and from 5 1 to 52 percent for black candidates. In Arizona, 74 percent of black and Native American candidates failed the state\'s 1 982 test; compared to 5 9 percent of Hispanic and 25 percent of white candidates (ToCh, 1983 ) . The decrease in supply of teachers has led to teacher shortages in some of these states and to countervailing actions like the issuance of interim or provisional certi ficates to offset the supply effects of the tests (SRES, 1 979) . School districts in Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana recruit many of their teachers from out of state, while many positions in Louisiana are filled by uncerti fied personnel. In South Carolina, several thousand teachers teach outside of their fields of certification (Galambos, 1980; Florida Education Standards Commission, 1982; Louisiana State Department of Education, 1982; Wool ford et al., 1982) . Harris (1982) estimates that the shortfall of several thousand teachers annually in Texas will reach crisis proportions by 1985 . The differential failure rates for b lack and white teacher candidates have also spurred a new round of lawsuits against states. Despite the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in .!l. .s.. Y.,.. South Carolina (1978) upholding the constitutionality of the NTE for certi fication purposes, SUits pending in Florida, Alabama, and North Carolina are challenging the use of the tests on the grounds that they intentionally discriminate against black applicants. These lawsuits will undoubtedly involve questions about the validity of the tests as measures of teacher competence as well as questions about the appropriateness of other uses of the test. Both Florida and Alabama, f.;)r example, have enacted provisions making state approval of teacher education i,nstitutions contingent\' on graduates\' performance on the competency tests.\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nOther state uses of teacher test resul ts suggest that the competency tests will inf luence the content of the curriculum in teacher education institutions. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia are using NTE results for statewide studies of teacher education (ETS, 1982) . In South Carolina, teacher education institutions are required to use NTE results as part of their own in-house evaluation process. One objective of this study is to discover to what extent and in what ways teacher competency tests influe nce the content of teacher education either directly or through the state approval/accreditation process.\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n- 14 Commentaries on the state of the art of teacher education program review methods emphasize the difficulty of setting standards and criteria. As Koff and Florio ( 1977) remark of teacher education accreditation standards: [A] ccreditation as a quality control procedure is hardly an exact science. Every profession is responsible for developing a definition of quality that takes into consideration the complexities of the field it services. Education is not uniquely culpable, although the problem of accrediting SCDEs [schools, colleges, and departments of education] is particularly complex for four interrelated reasons. First, there is no clear consensus concerning educational goals. Second, there are substantive ,problems in relating educational outcomes t o the characteristics of professional educators. Third, there are no clear connections between training strategies and the characteristics of educators. Fourth, power politics have made it difficult to deal with the fundamental questions aSSOCiated with accrediting policy (pp.\r\n\r\n5-6 ) .\r\n\r\nMany know ledgeable scholars and practitioners have questioned the utility of accreditation and state program approval because of the lack of both uni formity and rigor in the criteria and assessment techniques (cf Cronin, 1981; Wheeler, \"1980; Getzels, 1977) . Thus, it would not be surprising to find that the availability of a presumably objective measure of student or program performance might assume a prominent role . in the evaluation of teachr education institutions. There is some evidence that competency test results are already affecting teacher education progams, at least in those institutions where graduates perform poorly on the tests. In response to high failure rates on the Florida test, the Dean of Florida A&M University\'s School of Education has announced plans t o raise the G. P. A. requirement for adm isSion to the school, require the use of essays in every course, and increase the number of required course hours in thematics and English (Toch, 198 3) . He expects these actions to reduce the school\'s enrollment from the current 600 to 4 00; a decrease of more than hal f from the 1, 000 students enrolled in 1978 . This move may mean the dif ference between survival and extinction for the program, since state approval in Florida is to be contingent on a pass rate of at least 8 0 percent of each institution\'s graduates. The Southern Regional Education Board has also announced a new effort to increase the use of analytic test questions in nine A predominately black colleges located in five states that use the NTE. consultant from ETS will work with SREB to revise questions submitted by faculty at the colleges while adding others t o build a pool of 1, 5 00 \"analytical questions\" for use in course examinations next fall (Aldrich, 1983) . Presumably, the use of such questions will lead to changes in course content as well.\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\n(\r\n\r\n- 15 Whether the s creening or curricular effects of the tests will lead to improved teacher quality is another question. There are two schools of thought about major influences on the supply of high quality teachers. Weaver (1978; 1979) argues that factors within education are mqst important, that decreased demand for teachers has led to a de cline -in the quality of sUPPly as schools of educations have attempted to This line of maintain enrollments by lowering their standards. reasoning leads one to expect improvement if competency tests raise standards in schools of education. Schlecty and Vance (1981) also note the recent decline in the number of academically able teaching candidates, but they argue that expansion of employment opportunities in other segments of the economy has had the most devastating effect on the quality of supply. Their research questions the utility of two major assumptions underlying efforts to upgrade entrance and exit standards: (1) that teaching is sufficiently attractive to academically able individuals to assure an adequate supply of teachers, and (2) that academically able persons attracted to teaching will remain in the profession. They find that relatively few academically able persons enter teaching, and most of those that do leave the profession within a few years. Thus, they reason, the main result of higher standards (without other changes in the relative attractiveness of the profession) will be a shortage of teacp ers. Cronin (1981) argues similarly that upgrading entry and exit standards may s creen out some candidates without ensuring that more able persons will choose the profession over otner more lucrative f ields marked by less \"bureaucratic harassment.\" While both s chools of thought have some merit, neither addresses the question of whether more \"academically able\" teachers will be better teachers. Will teachers who have passed a teacher competency test perform better in the classroom than those who have not? A number of studies of the validity of the NTE have been conducted with remarkably similar resUlts. Studies of the concurrent validity of the test--how well it correlates with other measures of academic ability or knowledge- find fairly strong relationship between NTE scores and s cores on other tests such as the Graduate Record Examinations (Pitcher, 1962; Quirk et al. , 1973; Ayers and Qualls, 1979) . More modest but still signi ficant relationships are found between NTE performance and undergraduate course preparation or grade point average (Willson and Stoller, 1981; Quirk et al. , 1973 ; Merritt, 1980; Andrews, Blackmon and Mackey, 1980; Ayers and Qualls, 1979) . [2] However, no studies have found any consistent [2] All of the subtests, however, are not equivalent on measures of concurrent validity. Willson and Stoller (1981) found substantial \"criterion-related validity\'\" for the NTE Hathematics subtest but very little for the Science subtest. Similar dis crepancies between teacher preparation concurrence with various NTE subtests were found in the study of concurrent validi ty conducted for the NTE in South Carolina when the state.\' s use of the test was being challenged in court (McDaniel, 1977) .\r\n\r\n- 16 rel a tio nship be tween NTE scor es and me asures of teach er performance i n th e classroom . Cor rel a tions be tween NTE scor es and desired teaching behav iors or outcomes are ge ner al ly no nsignificant; nega tive correl a tions occur ne arly as often as posi tive one s (Ay ers a nd Qual l s , 1979 ; Andrew s , Bl ackmo n and Mackey , 1 9 8 0 ; Quirk e t al . , 1 973). Although we do no t propo se to a s se s s th e v al idi ty âˆ‘of teach er compe te ncy tests in this study , we wil l examine perce pti o ns of th e co ncur r e nt a nd pr edi ctive val i dity of th e t e s t s.

Of cour se , if co ncurr ent val i di ty is pe rceived t o be low , th e faul t may lie either with th e test s or wi th th e co nte nt of teacher pr epa r a ti o n . In e i th er case , such perce pti on s woul d h ave important l e gal and pol icy implicati on s .

Perce ptions of predi ctive val idity of th e tests are impor t ant for the abov e reasons, and al so because such pe rce pti o ns may influe nce school di strict hi ring pr act i ce s .

Some distric t s , for exampl e , have used NTE scor es t o r ank t e achers for hiring and have th e n based sal ari es on th e r anki ngs .

Not only have the the Scholastic Aptitude Tests scores declined since the, mid 19608, but more and more high school graduates are not eV1l functionally literate. Last week the National Assessment of Eduction. Progress, a federally sponsored project for monitoring: the nation\'s: schools, reported thatding skills are continuing to worsen in the HigIi\' ,\'  school years. In an attempt to reverse this trend, and meet tt,te growing concerils:,ol, parents, the state Board of Regents has just voted to require certifieaticm examinations for all new teachers. We believe the idea is a good one. Some teachers have objected to the proposed examinations, saying other professionals - doctors,\\for example;.... are not required to pass\'. state-imposed test and teachers should not be singled out. They also say thah written examination may provide a gauge for judging how much a teacher knows, but it can do nothing to predict who a good teacher will b4!: it cannot measure such intangible ,things as creativif;Y or sensitivity,  it cannot measure a teacher\'s effectiveness in mamtaining classrooft,l \' , order. There is much merit to these argumen. Indeed, it is\' probably true that any written\'test the Regentsinay choose will have at leas some of the deficiencies these teachers have predicted. On the other hand, the procedure for determining competency that has been proposed does, \'to some extent, take these objections into account. After having passed the initial exam, prospective teachers will be required to spend a one-year internship teaching under the supervision of a \"mentor,\" an experienced teacher specifically trained for the task. It is during this period that thÂ¢ specific, intangible, teaching abilities of the intern will be able to  \' observed and, in some sense, graded. Regarding the objections to testing in general, the principle of testing public workers - namely, the CivU5ervice workers - is long established.

It has been\r\n\r\nrecognized that schoo ls cannot offer high qua lity services if the schoo ls are not staffed by high qua lity individua ls. It is popu lar to decry the mediocrity of pub lic schoo l teachers and administrators and to somehow characterize pub lic schoo l personne l as fai lures who cannot be successfu l in other endeavors. We are a l l fami lar with the o ld bromide\r\n\r\nthat those who cannot succeed in the \"outside wor Id\" become teachers and that teachers who cannot succeed in the c lassroom become administrators. the pub lic schoo ls. This be lies the rea l wor ld of\r\n\r\nThere are many exce l lent and outstand-\r\n\r\ning teachers and administrators in pub lic schoo ls whose performance is far more va luab le than the modest compensation those individua ls receive. However, it must be recog-\r\n\r\nnized a lso that there are both teachers and administrators in public schoo ls whose performance is be low minima l ly acceptab le standards and these individua ls need to improve their performance or leave education. 1 A lbert Shanker, president\r\n\r\nof the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), has said that, One of the great virtues of the current wave [of education reform] is that it recognizes the classroom teacher as the key to a good education Many of the recent reports list recommendations designed to retain our teaching force and attract new talent, but it is inevitable that any discussion of teacher quality will also deal with the question of how to get rid of incompetents. l/\r\n. âˆ‘ . .\r\n\r\nHere is clear recognition on the part of a major, influenâˆ‘\r\n\r\ntia 1 teacher union leader that (1) steps need to be taken to attract and retain good teachers (and by extension, good administrators), and (2) steps also need to be taken to rid the schools of incompetent teachers and administrators. This cannot be accomplished without an effective system of teacher and administrator evaluation. / Yet, the evaluation of personnel is a muddled arena with muc criti6ism levied at the current state of practice. Evaluation theorist Michael Scriven has poignantly written: Teacher evaluation is a disaster. The practices are shoddy and the principles are unclear. Recent work has suggested some ways to clarify the issue and to make the procedures more equitable and reasonably valid, but one cannot\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n1.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\"Old \'Cures\' Floated for Incompetence,\" New York Times (January 22, 1984) . While this paper will speak of \"teacher evaluation\" or \"teacher and administrator evaluation,\" the reader should assume evaluation of all school personnel including paraprofessionals, guidance personnel, librarians, other professional personnel, and non instructional employees.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nyet point to a single exemplary system in which practices come near to matching our knowledge. 21 Scriven, I believe, is .not engaging in hyperbole. He is not\r\n\r\nat all exaggerating the current state of practice in the evaluation of teachers and administrators. In fact, teacher\r\n\r\nevaluation is probably better off than the evaluation of administrators, for the latter has been largely ignored. From a legal standpoint this all presents a problem of obvious nature. How can the dismissal of educational\r\n\r\npersonnel who are not considered to be minimally adequate, in a process that requires some degree of formalism, be based on a system that is a quagmire of inconsistencies, replete with lack of objectivity and reliability, and devoid of clear purposes and criteria for performance? commentator has stated the problem as follows: ,Although no one would question the importance of good teaching to the provision of good education, the appraisal of teacher performance has presented numerous and nettlesome problems. One major problem inherent in teacher evaluation is that there is no clear definition of what characterizes an effective teacher or constitutes effective teaching, and, consequently, no definitive measures to be used for teacher Any evaluation process is essentially evaluation. a comparison of desired outcomes with actual out If the situation exists where not only the comes. results but in many cases the desired outcomes are in question, then the task of evaluation becomes extremely difficult. 1 \"Summa tive Teacher Evaluation,\" in Jason Millman, ed. , Handbook of Teacher Evaluation (Beverly Hills, Calif. : Sage Publications, 1981), p. 244. 4.

One\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWhilp.\r\n\r\nthe current stat( of teacher and admlnistrtive eval\r\n\r\nuation may be dismal, the demand for effective evaluation is grea t. Criticisms of the public schools have been rampant. Declining standardized test scores have caused the public to ques tion the pe rformance of the public schools. Declining\r\n\r\nenrollments and reductions in force have presented to the public an image of the schools that suggests turmoil and the\r\n..\r\n\r\ninability to manage effectively and efficiently.\r\n\r\nTax re\r\n\r\nvolts, revenue limitations, economic recession, and a federal government that has severely curtailed federal aid to public schools have combined to leave schools with fewer resources with which to provide services. Higher propor\r\n\r\ntions of pupils with special needs have increased require ments on schools for expensive special programs and ser vices. At the same time deteriorating working conditions\r\n\r\nand lack and competitive salaries have decreased the number and quality of college graduates seeking teaching positions. For public schools to provide quality instruc tion requires quality personnel in the schools. As Shanker sug\r\n\r\ngests, there is consensus that the teacher is the key to this. However, maintaining quality teaching requires\r\n\r\nfair and effective systems of teacher and administrator evaluation, something we do not now have. Any system of personnel evaluation in public schools, to be adequate in meeting the needs of the school system, must effectively address the following questions:\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\no o\r\n\r\nHow can we attract and retain high quality teachers? How can we help good classroom teachers to improve their performance?\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\nHow can we help poor classroom teachers to improve their performance?\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\nHow can we remove irremediably sub-standard teachers from schools?\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\nHow can we provide competent, knowledgeable, and effective administrators who will be instructional leaders?\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\nIf a school district implements\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\nmaster teacher,\r\n\r\ncareer ladder, merit pay, or some other performance based system of rank and salary differentiation, how can the necessary determination of performance be made? o How can we insure that the evaluation system will be equitable, effctive, and efficient? Laura Means Pope provides another list of questions concerning evaluation that is derived from judicial decisions in personnel evaluation cases in public schools\'2/ These legal\r\n\r\nissues provide a complement to the educational issues raised above. o Pope\' s list of questions includes: What are evaluation statutes?

Both\r\n\r\nBoth sets of questions must\r\n\r\nbe answered in the light of what will improve the quality of public education while protecting the rights of all indivi duals involved. The remainder of this paper will be a\r\n\r\ndiscussion of those questions from the perspective of a teachers\' union which is concerned about both the quality of educational services and the future of public education in the United states, as well as the best interests of its own members.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nAn AFT Perspective on Evaluation The American Federation of Teachers is an AFL-CIO affil iated labor union with over 580, 000 members nationwide. membership includes elementary and secondary teachers, college professors, paraprofessionals, non-instructional school employees, state government employees, and health care workers. While the AFT\'s strength traditionally has Its\r\n\r\nbeen in the metropolitan areas of the Northeast, Midwest, and Far West, the AFT membership is growing rapidly in the South and Southwest. In the South Central and Southwest\r\n\r\nregions, AFT local unions bargain teacher contracts in such places as New Orleans, Corpus Christi, Oklahoma City, and Albuquerque. When proposals for education reform became\r\n\r\na topic of national debate, the AFT position was one of openness and willingness to discuss change which would bene fit the public schools and improve education. The AFT has\r\n\r\nrecognized the serious problems facing public schools and has pursued policies which it thinks will provide pragmatic and reasonable solutions to those problems. While the AFT\r\n\r\nhas no recent, comprehensive policy statement on teacher evaluation, traditionally it has supported the development of fair and equitable systems of evaluation which recognize and reinforce teachers\' strengths and provide constructive feedback and assistance in overcoming deficiencies in in structional practice. In a 1983 policy resolution on the\r\n\r\nsubject of education reform, the AFT convention, the highest AFT policy-making body, stated that,\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nEvaluation cannot be left to principals and supervisors who have traditionally made subjective judgements about teacher competence based more on favoritism and patronage than merit. New evaluation patterns should be negotiated and must offer protections against subjectivity and local school politics.Â£/ In fact, in Toledo, Ohio, the school district and the teachers\' union, an AFT affiliate, have instituted a program of peer evaluation of beginning teachers which removes evaluation responsibilities from principals and supervisors and provides peer assistance for teachers with deficiencies. In 1982, in a resolution on \"Teacher Preparation and Quality Education,\" the AFT convention adopted a policy which included the following elements relating to both preservice and in-service teachers which have a direct bearing on evaluation:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThe granting of the initial teacher certificate should be based on evaluation of a wide range of factors, including (a) successful completion of a rigorous college teacher education program, (b) successful completion of a written examination assessing acceptable levels of competence in basic skills, pedagogy, and subject matter knowledge, and (c) personal attributes and accomplishments.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nState and federal funds should be appropriated for research and development of unbiased and job-related test questions to accomplish the above. Teacher\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nAmerican Federation of Teachers, \"Resolution on Educa tion Reform,\" in AFT Convention Report 1983 (Washington, DC: the author, 1983) p. 66.\r\n----\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, educational researchers, and testing specialists should be significantly involved in this process.\r\n3.\r\n\r\nA permanent teaching cer\'tificate should only be gr\'anted after\' successful completion Or\' a one-to-two year\' teaching internship progr\'a.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nInservice teacher\'s should be affor\'ded the opportunity for\' professional gr\'owth through teacher r\'elease time and compensation for time outside the norma I school day spent on updating and refining teaching skills.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nCollabor\'ative staff development activities, such as teacher\' center\'s, be available to serve all teachers.\r\n\r\nIn a r\'ecent New York Times column, AFT president Alber\'t Shanker, addressed three additional issues r\'elating to the evaluation of inservice teacher\'s: the abolition of tenur\'e, r\'ecer\'tification of teacher\'s, and r\'etesting inser\'vice teacher\'s. Shanker\' argues that ther\'e is no evidence that\r\n\r\nthe abolition of tenure and the consequent easier ter\'mina tion of substandar\'d teachers would lead to better teaching. He cites the exa mples of Texas and Mississippi, which do not have tenure, and asks if ther\'e is clear evidence that educa tion in those states is super\'ior to that in other\' states because of the lack of tenur\'e. The obvious answer\' is that\r\n\r\nthe lack of tenure has not led to super\'ior\' education in those two states. Shanker posits that one problem with\r\n\r\nrecer\'tification is that it adds exceptional insecurity to the other\' disadvantages of teaching and would discour\'age\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nquality college graduates from entering teaching, especially when recertification is not required in other professions. He also suggests that recertification and retesting of inservice teachers might be more palatable if other professions, such as medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and law had the same requirements.ZI He concludes by saying that\r\n\r\nYou can\' t blame teachers for feeling that they are being scapegoated when these proposals are floated by officials who are trying to hire teachers at $12,000, $13,000 and $14,000 a year, who don\'t bother giving teachers a test before they\' re hired, and who don\' t follow a policy of granting tenure only to those who meet very high standards during their probationary period.8 1 The AFT does not oppose good teacher evaluation systems, but welcomes them. When correctly conceived, developed, and\r\n\r\nimplemented, they will lead to the improvement of education.\r\n\r\nEvaluation and the Political Economy of Education The evaluation of teachers and administrators takes place within the context of organizations. Garms, Guthrie,\r\n\r\nand Pierce have stated that, \"Organizations can be viewed as a set of opportunities to and restrictions on the ability of people to improve their well being.\" 2/ This political\r\n\r\neconomy approach to educational institutions as organizations stresses the need to look at incentives to particular 7. 8. 9.

Pierce,School Finance: The Economics and Politics of Public Education ( Englewood Cliffs, NPrentice-Hall, Inc., 1978 ) , p. 76.\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nbehavior that individuals have in organization.\r\n\r\nComplex\r\n\r\norganizations can only be understood when the behavior of individuals within can be explained and that behavior can usually be understood as rational, self-interested persons trying to maximize their own benefits. 1QI Any teacher and\r\n\r\nadministrator evaluation system that will be successful will be one that is built on the recognition that it must satisfy the needs of everyone in the organization as a whole. The\r\n\r\nevaluation system for school personnel must satisfy three basic criteria recognized in political economy: equity, effectiveness, and efficiency. The evaluation system needs If\r\n\r\nto be perceived by all who are invol ved with it as fair.\r\n\r\nit is perceived as being unfair it will be resisted by those who see the inequities and may be easily sabotaged. Personnel who feel they are treated unfairly will challenge the evaluation system in the courts, or other avenues of redress available. If the personnel system is not effective\r\n\r\nin recognizing exemplary staff, in providing media for improvement of staff showing deficiencies, and in leading to the dismissal of deficient staff who cannot improve, then the evaluation system will be regarded as a joke and will not be taken seriously. An evaluation system will be effec-\r\n\r\ntive if everyone has a self-interest in making it work. Finally, the system must be efficient. It is not in the\r\n\r\npublic interest to have a system in which the cost exceeds 10. See William Lowe Boyd, \"The Political Economy of Public Schools, \" Education Administration Quarterly, Vol. 18, No. 3 (Summer 1982) 111- 130, for a more complete discussion of the issue.\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nany benefit gained from the system.\r\n\r\nThe cost-benefit calcu-\r\n\r\nIus must produce a positive yield Â£or the school system. Equity, effectiveness, and efficiency are inexorably linked together. A system that is not equitable will not be By definition, an Boyd argues\r\n\r\nable to achieve maximum effectiveness.\r\n\r\nineffective system can hardly be efficient. that,\r\n\r\nOf course, considering the perversities of the reward structure and career ladder of public schools, it is remarkable that as many public schools perform as well as they do. That they do is a tribute to dedicated educators who perform well, more or less in spite of But would it not be the existing reward structure. more reasonable to change the structure to one that encourages, rewards, and helps maintain meritorious performance?.:!..:!/ An equitabl e, effective, and efficient system of evaluating teachers and administrators could do that. The system is an\r\n\r\nobvious failure if it does not encourage, reward, and maintain meritorious performance. It is in the self-interest of teachers to have a steady and stable job, with adequate compensation, adequate psychic rewards, and a minimum of criticism or negative intervention from administrators. If parents do not complain and stuA\r\n\r\ndents do not create problems, the satisfaction increases.\r\n\r\nbuilding administrator has it in his or her self-interest to have few problems from teachers, parents, or students and to have the support and approval of central office administrators, the school board, and the public. The central office\r\n\r\nadministrators and school board membrs tend to want a smooth 11. Boyd, p. 123.\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nunning system with\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\nminimum of poblems and the financial\r\n\r\nand emotional ewads of a system egaded as pefoming well. It is no accident that it is, theefoe, in evey-\r\n\r\none\'s self-inteest to have a system with competent pesonnel whee childen lean. Evey goup within the\r\n\r\nsystem has it in thei self-inteest to cea te an organization which pefoms the way it is supposed to. Dissatisfied paents tend eithe to take their children out of the sc hool system to othe public systems o to pivate schools, o to become politically active to change what they ae dissatisfied with in the public schools./ The fome leads to declining enrollment and etrenchment and the latte to political turmoil. It is in the self-\r\n\r\ninterest of all school pesonnel to minimize these thre?ts through satisfying parents. This discussion all leads to the argument that an equitable, effective, and efficient personnel evaluation system is in everyone\'s self-interest. as it might seem to some.\r\nIt\r\n\r\nThis idea is not as alien\r\n\r\nwas James Madison in The\r\n\r\nFederalist No. 10 who argued that the pluralistic conflict among various self-interests would produce a stability and balance contributing to the general good. Madison unde-\r\n\r\nstood that one could not eliminate self-interest, so the onl y solution was to control self-interest in a broad\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\nSee Boyd, pp. 119- 12 1, and Albert O. Hirschman, Exit, Voice, and Loyalty ( Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Universi ty Press, 1970) for a more complete discussion of the \"exit-voice\" option.\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\npublic policy sphere.\r\n\r\nA political economic framework of\r\n\r\nanalysis helps make this clear. All parties benefit from an evaluation system which rewards and encourages those who perform well and provides a medium for improvement, or a process for dismissal, for those who do not perform up to adequate standards. This can\r\n\r\nbe summed up in its negative sense by saying tha t \"an incompetent teacher or administrator hurts us all.\"\r\n\r\nEvaluation Procedures However, the real world of teacher and administrator evaluation does not always match the ideal world described above. Just as our Founding Fathers realized that a consti-\r\n\r\ntution in action was not always the same as a constitution in \"parchment,\" there are real world factors and constraints which complicate the process of personnel evaluation. Dean Webb discusses the conflicting purposes of evaluation . .:121 She says that, L.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, evaluation is perceived as having positive results such as the improvement of instruc tion and the identification and encouragement of effective teachers. However, in the lexicon of the teacher, evaluation often has been viewed as a basis to make nonretention, demotion, reassignment, or dismissal decisions. The situation created by these varying interpretations often generates negative feelings among those being evaluated and those doing the evaluating.1i1 In the abstract everyone welcomes good evaluation. 13. 14. Webb, p. 69. Ibid. In prac-\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\ntice there are problems which emerge which generate the negative feelings about evaluation to which Webb makes reference. The next section will discuss some of the prac These\r\n\r\ntical issues in evaluation of education personnel.\r\n\r\nwill be viewed from the point of view of educational issues, substantive due process, and procedural due process.\r\n\r\nEducational Issues in Evaluation Most systems of teacher evaluation are based on an out dated model of schooling. In the early years of the twen\r\n\r\ntieth century most teachers did not possess a college degree. Teachers were high school graduates with one or\r\n\r\nmore years of normal school training who often were just a few lessons ahead of their own students in what they were teaching. The only college educated person, the only true He or she\r\n\r\nprofessional, in th e school was the principal.\r\n\r\nwas a scholar who provided leadership for and supervised the teachers, who corresponded to workers in an industrial setting. This industrial model of schooling and teaching\r\n\r\nrequired a system of evaluation th3t was relatively formalistic and rigid with checklists and rating scales. The professional evaluated the workers and provided concrete evaluation of classroom performance. Schools have changed considerably over the last few decades. Today teachers are college graduates and about In their\r\n\r\none-half have earned a masters\' degree or more.\r\n\r\nown teaching area the teacher usually has more expertise\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nthan the pincipal o supeviso.\r\n\r\nThe setting appoaches a\r\n\r\ncollegial elationship of pofessionals with equal ank but diffeentiated duties and esponsibilities. The old indus\r\n\r\ntial model of evaluation is no longer appropriate, but in practice it has never died. in many school systems. Today it is still the norm\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that teachers and\r\n\r\nadministrators alike are unhappy and disillusioned with evaluation. They continue to be captive of an evaluation\r\n\r\nsystem designed for cicumstances that have not existed for decades. From an educational standpoint, three basic questions must be answered: o What is the appropriate way to evaluate pre-service teachers? (How can we ensure the entry of only\r\n\r\nhighly qualified people into the teaching profession?) o What is the appropriate way to evaluate probationary teachers? (How can we structure mediated entry to\r\n\r\nensure that only the best qualified are retained in teaching?) o What is the appropriate way to evaluate vetean, inservice teachers? (How can we rid the teaching\r\n\r\ncorps of those who no longer meet minimum standards?) For each of these three broad aeas questions must also be addressed relating to purposes of evaluation, criteria fo evaluation, evaluation procedures, and the use of evaluation results.\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nThe Purposes of Evaluation.\r\n\r\nBy purposes I do not mean\r\n\r\nhow the evaluation results will be used, but rather what is being sought. By illustration, one way of differentiating\r\n\r\namong purposes is to distinguish among the following12/: o teacher competency, referring to individual skills, knowledges, or values; o teacher competence, referring to the repertoire of individual competencies; o . teacher performance, referring to what the teacher actually does on the job; and o teacher effectiveness, referring to the effect the performance of the teacher has on student outcomes. In order to have an effective teacher evaluation system, a school district needs to decide for which one of these purposes, or combination of purposes, it wants to evaluate. A program to evaluate teacher competencies, for example, would be designed and implemented very differently from a program to evaluate teacher effectiveness. Most school\r\n\r\ndistrict evaluation programs would seem to evaluate teacher performance. An evaluator cannot make a decision if the\r\n\r\nevaluator does not know what he or she is seeking. Criteria for Evaluation. 15. Within the purposes cited\r\n\r\nBased on Donald Medley, \"Teacher Competency Testing and the Teacher Educator,\" (Charlottesville, VA: Associa tion of Teacher Educators and the Bureau of Educational Research, University of Virginia, 1982) , as discussed in Linda Darling-Hammond, Arthur E. Wise, and Sara R. ,Pease, \"Teacher Evaluation in the Organizational Contex t: A Review of the Literature,\" Review of Education al Research Vol. 53, No. 3 (Fall 1983), pp--. 304-305.\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nabove, the designers of an evaluation system must choose the specific criteria or mix of criteria to be used. For exam-\r\n\r\npIe, if the purpose of teacher evaluation is determined to be teacher effectiveness, then the system must decide what constitutes an effective teacher. Cohen\' s review of the\r\n\r\nliterature on teacher effectivenesslÂ£/ suggests that the following are attributes of effective teaching: teacher\r\n..\r\n\r\nexpectations and role definitions are important; classroom management is important; there is active, direct instruction by teachers; and academic learning time is important, including time allocated to instruction, engaged time, and success rate. However, Cohen also suggests that within these\r\n\r\ndomains of classroom management and instructional practices there are several alternative classroom structures for effective teaching. Teachers may choose those practices\r\n\r\nwhich work best with different classes and instructional goals. Under these circumstances, the choice of evaluative\r\n\r\ncriteria is a difficult job which requires much study and planning. The simple point is that once a school district\r\n\r\ndetermines the purposes for which they want to evaluate, the development of evaluation criteria is a critical and compIex next step\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nEvaluation Procedures. 16.\r\n\r\nSome evaluation criteria may and Social Odden and L. Improvement: Ballinger\r\n\r\nMichael Cohen, \" Instructional, Management, Conditions in Effective Schools,\" in Allan Dean Webb, eds. School Finance and School Linkages for the 1980\'s (Cambridge, Mass. : Publishing Co. , 1983), pp. 24-29.\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nsuggest particular procedures of evaluation, but often the choice is not clear. A wide variety of procedures exist and One\r\n\r\nmany evaluation programs use one or a combination.\r\n\r\nlisting of evaluation procedures includes teacher interviews, competency tests, indirect measures, classroom obser vations, student ra tings, peer review, use of student achievement data, and self-evaluations. !l l The problems\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nassociated with the choice of purposes, criteria, and procedures is clearly stated by Darling- Hammond, Wise, and Pease when they write: A judgement of success depends on the purposes for which a technique is used as well as its ability to measure what it purports to measure. Some of these approaches seek to measure competence while others, that rely on direct observation, seek to measure performance. Still others rely on student performance as a measure of teacher competence and performance. The generally low levels of reliability, generalizability, and validity attributed to techer evaluation methods suggest that unidimensional approaches for assessing competence, performance, or effectiveness is unlikely to capture enough information about teaching attributes to completely satisfy any of the purposes of teacher evaluation. 1 None of this presents an image of teacher evaluation as a simple process, and, in fact, it is not. A properly devel-\r\n\r\noped teacher evaluation system can be costly as well as complex.\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nThe cost in terms of both time and money of\r\n\r\ndeveloping the appropriate criteria and valid and reliable procedures, training the evaluators, orienting the teachers to the system, and maintaining an ongoing evaluation of 17. 18. Darling- Hammond, Wise, and Pease, pp. 304-308. p. 308.\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nthe teacher evaluation program can be very high.\r\n\r\nAs\r\n\r\nsuggested above, a school district must weigh the costs of such a program against the benefits\' gained. It must also\r\n\r\nbe kept in mind that a simple, but less effective or valid program can be more costly in terms of human resources wasted, lack of educational benefit, and higher incidence of litigation. Use of Evaluation Results. Education is one of the few\r\n\r\nareas of human enterprise where if an employee is determined to have particular deficiencies, that employee is terminated from employment and a less experienced employee is hired as\r\na\r\n\r\nreplacement.\r\n\r\nNo businessman who wanted to stay in busi-\r\n\r\nness and earn a profit would tolerate such a wasteful practice. One of the uses of the results of teacher evaluaOnce a school\r\n\r\ntion should be a staff development program.\r\n\r\ndistrict chooses what it wants in terms of teacher competencies, performance, and effectiveness and has assessed its teachers on such criteria, then the logical next step is the development of a staff development program to meet those ends. Education and training is a sensible step to I n the long run it is more\r\n\r\nupgrading teacher proficiency.\r\n\r\neffective and efficient for a school system to do this than to operate a revolving door system of teachers coming and going with the hope that somehow the right mix of staff can be found. The precise same things can also be said about The\r\n\r\nthe evaluation and staff development of administrators. success of a school system depends on the effective and\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nefficient achievement of high qual ity teachers and administrators. A final comment about educational issues in teacher and administrator evaluation is in order. should be an evolving system. Any evaluation system\r\n\r\nThe purposes, criteria, and\r\n\r\nprocedures should be regularly reviewed and brought up to date to reflect changing circumstances. The system should\r\n\r\nbe a living, flexible system in which the teachers, administrators, school board members, and community all share confidence and which they all can support.\r\n\r\nSubstantive Due Process in Evaluation The issue of substantive due process in evaluation is a bridge between the purely educational issues and the purely legal issues. Webb defines substantive due process in\r\n\r\nteacher evaluation in the following manner. Violations of substantive due process occur when the government denies individual rights to liberty and property through acts that represent an arbitrary exercise of government power. In considering sub stantive due process claims, the courts go beyond the procedural questions to examine the justifica tion for the action. The question of sUbstantive fairness in school board employment decisions predicated on teacher evaluations primarily center on the question of whether the evaluations were sufficient to meet the requisite standard of substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is that which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. 12/ The purpose of the extended discussion of education issues in teacher evaluation was the recognition that the results 19. Webb, p. 76\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nof teacher and administrator evaluation is not just to provide valid and reliable informa tion for staff developmen t and employee improvement decisions and programs, but such data are also used to make other employment decisions involv1ng promotion, transfer, and dismissal. These\r\n\r\ndecisions may well involve protected rights of the employees invo 1 ved. The point to be rna de here has been stated in a\r\n\r\ndifferent manner. The legal content of teacher evaluation has a moral point. It is designed to promote fairness. It is, thus, important to see the legal aspects of teacher evaluation against the background of the moral concepts that they are intended to realize. 20/ This moral imperative involves the equal respect of persons and reasonableness. / It is important that the job deci\r\n\r\nsions be made on the basis of information that is valid and reliable. Those being evaluated must also feel that the This is a critical point in\r\n\r\nsystem is fair and reasonable. preventing legal problems.\r\n\r\nSimply stated, a teacher or\r\n\r\nadministrator who feels unfairly or unreasonably treated wil go to court, and should. Strike and Bull state that \"the evaluator must distinguish between information that is and information that\r\nn\r\n\r\nis not relevant to judgements about teachers\' abilities. \"22/\r\n\r\n20.\r\n\r\nKenneth Strike and Barry Bull, \"Fairness and the Legal Context of Teacher Evaluation, \" in Jason Millman, ed. , Handbook of Teacher Evaluation, p. 303.

However, dismissal can be\r\n\r\njustified if the school board can show sUbstantial evidence of inadequa te performance, e specially if the teacher or administrator has been afforded an adequate opportunity for remediation. Problems arise when the record is not clear or\r\n\r\nis inadequate; no opportunity for remediation has been provided, or an inadequate remediation period is provided; or if there is conflicting evidence on the performance of the teacher or administrator. Any of these latter circumstances\r\n\r\ncall into question the fairness or reasonableness of the process.\r\n\r\nProcedural Due Process in Evaluation Procedural due process concerns whether a teacher or administrator has been deprived of life, liberty, or property with due process of law. It is a guarantee of the FourThe U.S. Supreme\r\n\r\nteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\r\n\r\nCourt has applied due process to school employees according to the following manner: First, a determination must be made of whether the asserted individual interests are encompassed within the fourteenth amendment\' s protection of life, liberty, or property. If liberty or property interests are implicated, a determination must be made of what process is due. A property interest is a legitimate entitlement to continued employ ment that is created under the laws, rules, regulations, and contracts of the state.

Just as effective classrooms are nested in effective\r\n\r\nschools, effective schools are more likely to exist in well-managed school districts. Researchers and management practitioners have long\r\n\r\nknown that educational organizations are unique (Campbell, 1958; Miles, 1969) . Weick (1976, 198) has made much of the notion that educational\r\n\r\norganizations are tied together frequently and loosely,âˆ‘ rather than tightly or densely. Such loose coupling arises from a lack of concensus\r\n\r\non educational goals, a low level of faculty interdependence and, most significantly for this project,  lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation in schools. Of course, 100sâˆ‘ coupling also occurs because of\r\n\r\ninput variability arising primarily from differences in student ability. Loosely coupled systems promote adaptations, giving stability to the system but also limitin g the benefits of coordination. Thus, boards of education, general and area superintendents, and various instructional change agents face the problem of how to facilitate instructional improvement in an organization which, by its , very nature, limits the impact of their efforts toward coordination and systematization (Harrison and Cage, 1984) . This specifically was the flt need of the leaders of the Dallas Independent School District when they sought to join forces with the School Improvement Model researchers at Iowa State University. Over the\r\n\r\npast decade, professors Manatt and Stow and their colleagues have helped\r\n\r\n2 numerous districts and independent schools improve their performance appraisal procedures and management information systems; in short, creating a more tightly coupled or highly focused effort (Manatt and Stow, 1984; Stow and Sweeney, 1981; Look and Manatt, 1984) . See Exhibit\r\n\r\nfor a display of Computer-Assisted Teacher Evaluation/Supervision (CATE/S) . The proposed project is intended to provide a focused, total systems approach to\' evaluating and improving the performance of educational professionals .. for a district of 445 administrators and 6900 teachers via the following components: 1. Short-term and temporary modification of existing evaluation procedures for the next year, 2. Consulting advice and creation of instruments and procedures mandated by House Bill 72 (Texas Legislature, 1984) , 3. Creation of a completely new, total-systems approach to performance appraisal which is data-based, hooked to compensation, and which can he operated using microcomputers at the campus level with data transmission via modems to the district\'s mainframe computer,\r\n4.\r\n\r\nFinally, and perhaps most important, training all levels of management and selected teachers to operate the system and improve performance of all educational personnel.\r\n\r\nThis is a massive undertaking, hence the timeline for the project will be 42 months.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nINTRODUCT ION The Dallas Independent Schools, in common with many large, urban school districts, was confronted with a great number of problems in the late sixties and most of the decade of the seventies. The.twin issues\r\n\r\nof excellence and equity have always been intertwined with the concerns of a rapidly shifting population, student achievement declines, and the continuing search for the financial resources to provide a sound education for all children. The Dallas Independent Schools are\r\n\r\nuncommon, however, in their continuing determination and success in meeting and solving these problems. Dallas is always experimenting,\r\n\r\nalways striving, and always in the vanguard of public education, both in Texas and nationwide. \' It was that tradition, plus the opportunities and\r\n\r\nchallenges inherent in the new Texas School Reform Law (H. B. 72, 1984) , that led the district to enter into a dialog with the School Improvement Model team at the Reseach Institute for Studies in Education (R ISE) at Iowa State University. After preliminary discussions between Professor\r\n\r\nManatt and John Santillo, Assistant Superintendent for Personnel Services, a group of Dallas School leaders met with the RISE personnel and Virgil Lagomarcino, Dean of the College of Education, to discuss te feasibility of a joint effort to develop a Focused, Total-Systems Approach to Evaluating and Improving the Performance of Educational Professionals in the district (October 1-2, 1984) .\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting,\r\n\r\nthe Dallas team outlined the existing performance evaluation and compensation procedures and described the anticipated changes in the\r\n\r\n4 appraisal process components and the career ladder provisions resulting from the passage of H. B. 72. The RISE personnel, on their part, described the progress made in the past decade by their researchers in developing valid, reliable, and legally discriminating performance appraisal systems. (See Exhibit. )\r\n\r\nProfessors Manatt, Stow, Sweeney, and others at RISE were not unacquainted with career ladders, merit pay, and incentive plans either, having worked with the states of Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky, California, New York; thâˆ‘ Department of Defense Dependent Schools; and the Fairfax County Schools in Virginia on just such endeavors. Moreover, all of the Iowa State University professors and staff personally work under a differentiated compensation and/or merit system. Subsequent to that meeting and further exploration of the issues by the district personnel, a request for a proposal was made. Specifically,\r\n\r\nthe project was to respond to the following perceived needs of the school district. 1. Short-term and temporary modification of the existing teacher performance evaluation instrument and procedures for the 1984-85 school year. Similar changes are needed for\r\n\r\nadministrator evaluation and the instruments for evaluating 23 other job specialties. 2. Consulting and advice regarding the changes needed to comply with the dictates of H. B. 72 that invlve performance appraisal, training, and certification of appraisers and career ladder screening and differentiated compensation.\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThe specification of, and provisions for, a replacement for the existing performance evaluation system. The new\r\n\r\nmechanism. is to be a total systems approach,,ith a data base, âˆ‘\r\n\r\nfocus that overcomes the us\r\n\r\norganization\'s management, and\r\n\r\n:O \r\n\r\nCOUP1\r\n\r\n\'\r\n\r\nOf a school\r\n\r\nenered\' in microcomputers\r\n\r\nat the campus level and mainframe computer-based at the central administration level. 4. Training for all personnel involved was considered of paramount importance; training for the Board of Trustees and the Council to use the Management Information System to be developed; training for area offices to be sure the system is\r\n\r\nladder promotions, and provide remediation where needed. In regard to performance evaluation of professionals and career ladder provisis, each of the above needs must be met within the m.nd tes o\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKar= )\r\n\r\nW\r\n\r\nThe project envisions going much beyond those\r\n\r\nminimums, h weve to reach the status of a data-based, total system for evaluation, compensation, and remediation or removal of those personne\'l performing below district standards. The proposed project is more than just an updating of an appraisal system; it is an articulated administrator and teacher performance evaluation system coupled with powerful training components designed to\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nupgrade the performance of all professional employees in order to improve the district\'s instructional outcomes. As such, the 42-month\r\n\r\nendeavor is a total-systems approach based upon five years of basic research in the School Improvement Model (SIM) project directed by Dick Manatt and Shirley Stow (Manatt et al. , Occasional Papers, 1980-84).\r\n\r\nSeveral basic questions must be answered in order to determine what approach, or combination of approaches, for performance appraisal will be appropriate for this dynamic and striving public school district; viz. , 1. What are the criteria for effective teaching? tion? 2. other specialties? administra\r\n\r\nHow can the evaluation system enhance the existing staff development and curriculum improvement activities?\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nHow shall the district monitor, \'measure, and report performance?\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nHow does the district plan to help administrators and teachers improve after evaluation?\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nHow can such mass!ve amounts of performance information best be captured, stored, transmitted, decision-making? analyzed, and use for\r\n\r\nThe rationale for the e.ntire project may be best explained by the functions of the mutual-benefit evaluation systems previously developed by the RISE team. They are:\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nTo improve teaching and administration through the identification of ways to change teaching systems, management systems, teaching environments, or teaching behaviors.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nTo supply information that will lead to the modification of assignments, such as placements in other positions, promotions, and terminations.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nTo protect students from incompetence, and teachers from unprofessional administrators.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n5.\r\n\r\nTo reward superior . performance. To validate the school syst m\' s teacher/administrator selection process.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nTo provide a basis for teachers\' and administrators\' career planning and professional development.\r\n\r\n\' Methodology created by Dick Manatt and his team of performance appraisal consultants will be used to answer the performance evaluation questions. The methods will include, but will not be limited to,\r\n\r\nadvisory committee planning of system specifications; development of three philosophies for the district--evaluation, administration, and education; critical work activities (CWAs) identified for each administrative role via systems analysis; position descriptions updated and situational status detemined by interview teams and evaluation; supervisory skills enhanced by in-district inteventions provided by the consulting team.\r\n\r\n8 The proposed Dallas Independent School District Peformance Evaluation System would be unique in two very important ways. strong commitment to participative necessary. First, a\r\n\r\np lanning\r\n\r\nand involvement will be\r\n\r\nThis helps all prof essionals grow, but, more important, it The second unique\r\n\r\nprovides \"ownership\" of the components created.\r\n\r\nfeature of this endeavor is the provision of staff development activities to ensure that district administrators can operate the program after the consultants leave.

This should provide a model process and\r\n,\r\n\r\nsystem which will be recognized in Texas and nationally as a better way o do the always dif f icult task of evaluating performance and determining compensation in a school district. Although it is proposed that a conSUlting team headed by Dick Manatt will assist the Dallas Independent School District in the development of the various evaluation systems, this project is seen as a joint eff ort in which the district provides on-site coordination f or the development of all activities, with writing, training, and ata processing support provided by the consulting team. The RISE team will\r\n\r\nbe resp onsible f or the delivery of research data, gathering of demographic data, computer analysis of f ield test data, development of training protocols, training of evaluators, orientation of teachers and administrative staf f , and such other duties as may be mutually agreed\r\n\r\n9 upon by both parties. Maximum use will be made of Iowa State University\r\n\r\nairplanes to reduce costs of travel. The following plan has been developed on the premise that high level performance by all professional groups is absolutely essential if the district\'s goals are to be achieved. Since the district\' s future\r\n\r\ngoals are important to performance appraisal and compensation, it is imperative that all changes correspond to the long-range planning the district intends to do on its own. PROJECT PHASES (PROCEDURES)\r\nA 42-month timeline is envisioned.\r\n\r\nThree distinct phases will be Project\r\n\r\nnecessary, viz. , preparational, developmental, and operational. priorities are to include (in rank order) :\r\n1.\r\n\r\nA six-month, intensive endeavor to upgrade existing practice and to help Dallas contribute to the state initiatives (H.

Some Saturday work may be essential A concentrated period\r\n\"\r\n\r\nfor a prompt start-up of the project.\r\n\r\nof work will be necessary in the summer of 1985 and each subsequent summer. PHASE II-DEVELOPMENTAL During the 1985-86 school year, preliminary drafts of the performance evaluation plan, philosophy, objectives, performance areas, and criteria will be developed. The\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\noperational procedures and prototypic forms and reords for evaluation/compensation will be created. 2. During the spring of 1986, a full array of administrative systems-analysis techniques will be brought to bear on the problems of administrator performance evaluation.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nIt\'s January and the next election campaign will be in full swing soon. It\'s anticipated that the EA will be flooding the schools with flyers warning teachers that the AFT supports merit pay for teachers. How can building stewards neutralize this allegation? DISCUSSION: a. b. Steward needs to anticipate the issue and decide the appropriate time to address it. Steward must know the following: What is AFT\'s position on merit pay and career ladders and what\'s the difference? What is the rationale for this position (how can it be \"sold\" to teachers in terms of what\'s to be gained and lost through different strategies)? What are the negative results of NEA positions? How can this information best be presented to teachers and how will-timing affect its impact?\r\n\r\nc. d.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nA second-year teacher walks into the teachers\' lounge on the verge of \"losing it.\" She announces to anyone who will listen that she knows she is a good teacher, but she can\'t take it anymore. In her last class Johnny was doing a balancing act on the radiator, Mary and Cindy talked throughout the leson, a paper airplane hit her in the back of the neck, and on and on. She is going to turn in her resignation tomorrow. What, if anything, should the building steward do? DISCUSSION: a. Many people will respond that the steward should sit down and talk to the person. However, the person\'s problems persist and without help, the teacher has little chance of recovering discipline in the classroom and surviving. In addition to compassion, help has to be provided. In an ER&D site, expertise is immediately available. In others, the steward could find a compatible teacher effective in this area to work with the teacher or seek out a college faculty person who may provide assistance. Stewards should be aware that excellent resources are available from the Educational Issues Department The conclusion should be that rather than walking out of the room or simply lending an ear, assistance should be provided.\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\nc. d.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nIt\'s April and the next closely contested CB election will be held in mid-May. The building steward on Tuesday noticed that the Federation bulletin board consisted only of campaign flyers, while the Association bulletin board also included slick posters and statements on professional issues. This difference in school bulletin boards had existed so long. the steward noticed and thought about it for the first time. What should be done. considering a call to a busy union office evoked only a reply that no similar posters were available? DISCUSSION: a. Is this bulletin board situation acceptable or unacceptable and why?\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\nCreativity: 1. A quick thinker knows AFT-QuEST promotional materials are available and uses them on bulletin boards, even if it\'s unlikely teachers in this school will attend. 2. AFT professional issues booklets can be posted or left on tables stamped \"Compliments of the CFT Professional Issues Committee.\" The building steward can collect professional 3. articles, charts, etc. and use the same stamp. Persistence may be important here in convincing the local leadership that this need should be addressed in all schools and, if necessary, the local should become involved in developing bullet board kits on professional issues/image. A case can be built for foresight. A school committee could develop attractive postings specific to faculty concerns.\r\n\r\nc.\r\n\r\nd.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nIn September, the principal approached a very good regular teacher and asked to place three disabled students in his classroom. The teacher was more than willing. Since that time, eight more disabled children were added to the class. The teacher\'s pleas to the principal that the range of special needs in this class now made learning for any students impossible was met with a shrug of the shoulders and advice \"to do yo\'ur best.\" Other teachers, according to the principal, couldn\'t handle it. Hearing of this teacher\'s anxiety and despair, what short-term and long-term solutions might the building steward offer? DISCUSSION: a. Short term: Provide appropriate AFT booklets which in clude a series on how to handle various disabilities in the regular classroom; if children with learning dis abilities are involved, have a group meet, view and discuss AFT\'s film/videotape, \"The ACB\'s of Teaching the Learning Disabled Child;\" set up a small problem-solving group of a few excellent teachers who brainstorm with the affected teacher on how to cope with the situation until real relief comes; seek assistance from college of education faculty. Long term: Consider grievance possibilities; use IEP process and requirements to your benefit (consult various levels of AFT, if necessary); union contacts with admin istrators, parents and disability advocacy groups.\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nReading is not a systemwide problem, but in your middle school many students are reading at pre-primer to fourth grade reading levels. As the building steward, you\'ve heard many teachers express concern about this situation but the principal believes in social promotion and feels it would damage the school\'s public image if parents discovered their children could not read. Is the building steward powerless to ddress this concern of teachers? If not, what action should be taken? DISCUSSION: a. Is it the union\'s, and therefore the steward\'s, responsi bility to intervene? Why or why not?\r\n\r\nb. c.\r\n\r\nA union faculty committee is the best vehicle for dealing with this problem. Teachers can assess the extent of the reading de ficiencies, what conditions would be necessary to remediate, what is in their power to do as individuals and as a faculty and what would require administrative action and then devise strategies for ending the status quo. They can also gather information on the negative consequences of social promotion. What are possible sources of support for resources? For political action?\r\n\r\nd. 6.\r\n\r\nA new evaluation system has been established in your school system. Special teacher trainng sessions were provided prior to implementation, and most teachers were satisfied that procedurally the system was fair and equitable. As the building steward, you\'ve picked up that teachers, however, don\'t really understand the criteria on which they\'ll be judged and are very anxious about the meaning of new terms, such as overlapping, momentum, smoothness, thrusts and dangles. What, if anything, should you do as building steward? DISCUSSION: An exploratory committee would be useful here. What is the basis of the new criteria and terminology? (The likely answer is educational research.) Is it likely that our staff is doing these things but the terms are new to them? (Yes. ) What could we do to make our staff comfortable with the new jargon? (Workshops by knowledgeable people, articles, AFT publications, etc.) Following this, would ongoing teacher discussions of what these criteria mean and how they can best be implemented be useful?\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nAs you start school in September, you know that a referendum will be held in the spring to float a new tax levy for the \"starving school system\" and that even if it passes, some schools may have to be closed. Your own school has suffered from poor community and business relationships and may be a prime candidate for closure. Is this problem bigger than a single school or is there something you as building steward could do to increase the odds you and your colleagues can return to this preferred site next year? DISCUSSION: Obviously the union needs to be heavily involved in seeing the tax levy passes but in this situation these teachers may be benefitted by going an extra mile. A faculty union committee could be established to develop strategies to im prove the image and support of this school. Questions:\r\no o o\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\nHow do we reach out to the immediate community and business? Can we do a needs assessment of their concerns? How can we mobiIize\"our faculty to address these needs, \' e.g., speaking at organizational meetings, devising innova tive programs to bring additional resources into the schools, holding open hearings, making more phone contacts, etc. Are there other union-initiated programs our school could plug into?\r\n\r\n'),(5522,65,2,49,0,'Education Reform'),(5523,65,2,41,0,'A proposal by the Dallas Federation of Teachers on teacher evaluation'),(5524,65,2,39,0,'Dallas Federation of Teachers'),(5525,65,2,48,0,'Dallas Federation of Teachers,.

Thus, for many years boards of education and school administrators have been devising teacher evaluation procedures and systems to\r\n\r\nthese evaluation efforts have proved unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. creasing teacher insecurity and opposition to these evaluation procedures.\r\n\r\nsupposedly measure the competence of teachers.\r\n\r\nExperience in CCSD has shown that There Theâˆ‘\r\n\r\nhas been a lack of consensus on the goals of teacher evaluation that has lead to in\r\n\r\nThe procedural aspects of the present system has not proved to be equitable. a valid test of teacher competency.\r\n\r\nobjectivity of the evaluation procedures has been justly called into question.\r\n\r\naddition to these factors, CCSD teachers have never accepted the present system as in order for an evaluation instrument\r\n\r\nIn\r\n\r\nto be successful, teachers must agree that the procedu.re to be used is a true measurement of competency.\r\n\r\nreleased by the Rand Corporation in 1983,\r\n\r\nAccording to the study of teacher evaluations\r\n\r\nCFT generally agrees that all evaluation instruments are imperfect, area that he or she presumes to evaluate, enough time and objectivity to ascertain,\r\n\r\nprobably the best would be a competent evaluator, competent in the discipline\r\n\r\nbut that\r\n\r\narmed with a blank piece of paper, and\r\n\r\nwhat is going on in the classroom. we would like to react to TAP: General Comments:\r\n*\r\n\r\nWith that \"ideal\" evaluation process in mind,\r\n\r\nwithing the limits of human capabilities,\r\n\r\na portfolio,\r\n\r\nThe strength of the evaluation seems to be mUltiple observers,\r\n\r\nthe teacher behaviors seem fairly grounded in effective teaching research.\r\n\r\nthe teacher\'s self-assessment components and the fact that most of\r\n\r\nconsideration of\r\n\r\n12 is open to some questions.\r\n*\r\n\r\nThere doesn\'t seem to be much evidence of misuse of this research although Item\r\n\r\ninstrument.\r\n*\r\n\r\nThere is a problem doing both formative and summative evaluations in the same They are almost incompatible goals in one instrument.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between minimum competencies and maximum competencies in this instrument is often unclear.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThis process separates the role of principal and teacher observers. observers conference with the t meet with the principal to expli\'ld the observation?\r\n\r\n hers\r\n\r\nafter the observation?\r\n\r\nDo teacher observers\r\n\r\nDo teacher\r\n\r\n* Who are the teacher observers going to be? *\r\n\r\nHow will they be selected,\r\n\r\netc.?\r\n\r\nThere a re 48 behaviors on the instrument\r\n\r\n(38 to be observed in the classroom) .

If that has not been necessary before, why should it be used to satisfy the evaluator? Perhaps a teaher who demonstrates poor classroom management skills could do this to help that weakness\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n. Criterion 1 - Behavior 3: Will teachers have to develop this grading policy for each class they teach? There needs to be some flexibility here so teachers will have the right to change their grading policy if they desire. This behavior violates a very important right of teachers--the right to make certain professional decisions for their classes. To require a teacher to follow a prescribed format for grades does not enhance the professionalization of teaching. Criterion 2: What is the purpose in provideing a key for the tests? Isn\'t this merely additional paper work for the teacher that will in no way be used by the evaluator? What about discussion tests? Will teachers be required to write the discussion answer in their own style, write an outline of items to be included in their answer, or leave those blank? Who\'s to decide whether or not enough time was allotted for a particular objective? Again, this is a professional judgment reserved to the teacher within the confines of the course. Criterion 2 - Behavior 2: Who will determine what is \"efficient and relevant\" to the objective? Weekly and/or daily lesson plans should be beneficial only to the teacher who uses them. Again, professional judgment should be the rule concerning the necessity for such plans. Criterion 2 - Behavior 3: Again, who will determine whether or not the number of items on the. test are appropriate? Whether or not the items are clear and concise? Whether or not the items are too easy or too difficult? How many items to include on the test for each objective? These should be decisions made by the classroom teacher using his or her best professional judgment! The \"written\" classroom rules could also include Criterion 3 Behaviors 1 and 2: the school handbook (if there is one) and/or the \"CCSD Code of Conduct. \" Parents can also be informed through the school handbook, at PTA meetings or by contacting the teacher. Let\'s return some the responsibility for young people to their  parents!\r\n-\r\n\r\nCriterion 12: TAP\'s definition of professionalism is open to question; i. e. , dress code, follow school district policies, takes on extra duties (without compensation?) and handles school equipment reasonably. Are these the definition of professional? Why is participation in the teacher\'s union excluded? Criterion 4 Behavior 1: What happens if the teacher knows what to do, states it in a confident manner, and the students fail to respond? Is the teacher denied a rating of 3?\r\n-\r\n\r\nCriterion 5 Behavior 3: Sometimes teachers have little control over aspects of the physical environment, i.e. , sufficient numbers of comfortable, appropriate\r\n-\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.(\r\n\r\nCFT\'s Comments on TAP Page 5 desks and chairs, lighting, accoustics.

It has been held up as a significant step toward the reforms outlined in the carnegie Report, by such luminaries as Mark Tucker. It is imperative that association leaders andâˆ‘staff understand that agreement. The following is an analysis to assist in that understanding. The documents the staff worked from included the old comprehensive agreement, running from July 1, 1984 to June 30, 1987; the RTA additions and changes to the old agreement submitted to the mmbership for ratification and entitled \"Contract Ratification,\" dated September 2, 1987 (attached); and an undated memorandum on RTA letterhead entitld \"The Career in Teaching Plan, Revised The exact status of the career teaching memo is unknown. Draft... It appears to be a working paper for bargaining. Much of what appears in the national and education media on the contents of the Rochester agreement is not encased in contractual language, but rather is an interpretation of what was agreed to, or directions likely to be taken in future bargaining. The simple fact to keep in mind is that the structure of teacher pay, the structure of teaching jobs, and\' the role of teachers in school site decision making--all matters highlighted in the media--are not fully defined in the current agreement, but rather are matters to be delineated in future bargaining. )\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nSalary Increases The salary raises provided in the new contract are good in raw dollar terms, but there are factors that cause inequities among There are also structural changes, the impact of existing staff. which cannot be easily ascertained, which will undoubtedly affect over he long-term, teacher efforts to acquire more education. Clearly, the major focus has been on the recruiting salary at the BA beginning level and on changing the structure of how teachers are paid. For the 1987-88 school year, every teacher will receive an across the-board $4, 500 raise. This advantages the teachers on the lower steps of the schedule from a percentage raise standpoint. A beginning teacher with a BA degree will go from $18, 983 to $23,483, a 23.7 percent increase. A teacher on step 10 of the MA +30 lane would go . from $33, 031 to $37,531, a 13.6 percent increase. For the 1988-89 and 89-90 school years, some current teachers are assigned an index number based on the salary they earned in the 87-88 school year, and which will determine their raises for the others are given a flat 11 percent raise for 88next two years. 89, and another 11 percent raise for 1989-90. This latter group is called \"off schedule\"âˆ‘ and will over time be placed on the index. For a BA beginning teacher in 1986-87, on top of his/her $4, 500 raise in 87-88, he/she will receive another $2,583 in 88-89, and another $2, 867 in 89-90, thereby raising the beginning salary to The total raise for a beginning. teacher with a $28,935 in 89-90. BA degree over the three-year life of the contract will be $9,952, a 52. 5 percent increase. If the 8687 salary schedule had been kept in place with no changes, a beginning BA teacher could have expected $22, 021 by the 89-90 school year. The new contract therefore, gives a new sched4le increase to the beginning BA teacher of $6, 914, or 11.3 percent. For the MA +30 teacher on the loth step, he/she will receive, on top of the $4, 500 he/she received in 1987-88, $4,128 in 88-89, and in 89-90 11 percent, or another $4, 500. The total raise then for an MA +30, lOth step teacher would be about $13,128, a 39.7 percent raise over the life of the contract. If the 86-87 salary schedule had been kept in place with no changes, a MA +30, lOth step teacher could have expected $36, 448. The new contract therefore, gives a new schedule increase to the MA +30, lOth step teacher of 26. 6 percent. In essence, the teachers on the lower steps of the salary schedule continue their initial salary advantage over the experienced veteran teachers during the life of the contract. Comparatively, \' the Rochester settlement is no better than some settlements we are getting in Connecticut and elsewhere. For\r\n,\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nexample, a teacher on MA step 10 in 1986-87 of the salary schedule in Bridgeport, Connecticut (a district comparable to Rochester) will earn $38,649 in 1987-88 compared to $35, 204 in Rochester and $ 43,65 4 in 88-89 compared to $40,400 in Rochester. The Bridgeport In Fairfax County, agreement is for two years, not three. Virginia, an affiliate that agreed to significant changes in how teachers are paid (they accepted a merit pay concept), an MA, loth step teacher will go from $30,844 in 1986-87 to $44,646 in 198990, receiving a 44.7 percent increase over three years. A comparable teacher in Rochester will go from $31,512 to $44,850 over the same period, receiving a 42.3 percent increase. One thing to underscore in the Rochester and the Fairfax County settlements is that the big raises did not come without a strong hint that significant changes will occur in the job structure and/or pay structure of teachers.\r\n\r\nSalary structure As noted previously, by 1988-89 and for the 89-90 school year, Rochester teachers will not be paid for earning extra education credits. The old unified salary schedule has been changed. First, the clause in the previous agreement titled \"salary Credit for Advanced Training\" is expressly deleted in the new agreement. Second, at the end of the 1987-88 school year, some teachers are assigned an index number for determining their pay over the next tâˆ‘wo years. This index number is based on their positions on the 198788 traditional salary schedule which gives credit for years of experience and educational attainment. But once that index number is assigned to them in 198889, years of experience and educational attainment are not factors to be considered in the future. A teacher can do nothing to change his/her index number. Presumably this arrangement will carry over into succeeding agreements. To see how this all workS, we will look at a tenured teacher with a BA degree on step 4 of the salary schedule in 1986-87, and working towards an MA degree. He/she earns $22,021 in 1986-87. with the $4,500 increase in 1987-88 he/she earns $26,521. By virtue of this salary amount he/she is assigned index number 1.11 at the Residence Teacher level in 88-89 and receives $28,935. Let\'s assume that he/she obtains an MA during this school year thereby gaining a permanent teaching certificate and moves to the Professional Teacher level. He/she earns no extra money for this added education, but will be sometime in the future eligible to volunteer for the Lead Teacher level and perhaps a 20 percent increase in pay. The index levels and pay amounts for 1988-89 and 89-90 are as follows:\r\n\r\n4\r\n\"-\r\n\r\nIndex No. 1.11 1.22 1.33 1.44 1.55 1.66 1.77 1.88 1.99 2.10 2.21\r\n\r\n1988-89 28, 935 31, 802 34, 670 37, 537 40, 404 43, 272 46, 139 49, 006 51, 874\r\n\r\n1989-90 32, 118 35, 301 38, 484 41, 484 44, 850 48, 033 51, 215 54, 398 57, 581 60, 764 63, 947\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.,\r\n\r\n54, 741\r\n57, 609\r\n\r\nUnlike traditional salary schedules, teachers cannot change their index numbers, therefore a teacher assigned index number 1.11 can do nothing to move to index number 1.22 or higher. It is not a salary schedule but rather a pay rate chart based upon factors frozen in time and which cannot be changed by individual action. The top index numbers for the 1988-89 and 89-90 school years (2. 10 and 2 . 2 1) cannot be assigned any current employee. Therefore, the top scheduled pay for 89-90, listed as $63, 947 (index number 2. 21) , may not be received by anyone in the 89-90 school year. By the terms of the agreement, no one currently employed can be placed on these top index numbers in the 1988-89 and 89-90 school years The top scheduled pay for the 87-88 school year is $46, 453 The for one with a doctorate and 25 years teaching experience. top index number assigned to this person for computing 88-89 and 89-90 pay would be 1.99. There is no explanation in the agreement for index numbers 2. 10 or 2.21. The $70, 000 figure ballyhooed in the press, is not to be found in the new agreement. The closest a current teacher could come to the $70, 000, assuming a 20 percent differential (under discussion but not in the agreement) is paid lead teachers, would be a teacher with a doctorate and 25 years of experience in 1986-87. By 89-90, this teacher would earn $57, 874 as a Professional Level teacher, and 20 percent on top of that as lead teacher would give an annual salary of $69, 448. These calculations give insights into the anomalies inherent in the new Rochester salary structure. By the terms of the agreement, no teacher without a doctorate in 86-87 could be given a salary increase for education improvement, if he/she did get a doctorate in 88-89 or 89-90. The 20 percent differential for lead teachers is really speculative at this point. The agreement presented to the teachers for ratification merely states--II Lead teachers shall receive a Such pay stipend above their salary as Professional Teachers. will be in recognition of the additional time/work and additional\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nresponsibilities\". Lead teacher pay still has to be spelled out contractually through negotiations between the parties and, whatever that agreement is, will not be implemented before July 1,\r\n\r\n1988.\r\nIt is hard to ascertain by the terms of the agreement how new hires in 1 988-89 and 89-90 will be placed on the salary structure, particularly those who have tenure and are permanently certified. Under New York tenure law, an employing school board has the , discretion to grant or not grant tenure to a new hire who has tenure in another district. The district in such instances could put a new hire on tenure, or place him/her on probation for up to \' two years. Career Lacider The new agreement calls for all teachers to be divided into four categories by July 1 , 1988, under what it labels the \"Care.er in Teaching Plan\". These four categories are: Level I-- Intern Teachers (new hires with no previous experience) ; Level I I--\' Resident Teachers ( teachers without permanent certification) : Level I I I-- Professional Teachers (tenured teachers with permanent certification) ; and Level IV--Lead Teachers (professional teachers who volunteer, and are selected, for certain instruction and professional related functions to be determined by a Joint Governing Panel) . Residence Level Teachers are placed on index numbers 1.,11, 1.2 2, 1.33, or 1.44 depending on their credited experience and degree level in 1986-87. Professional level teachers are placed on index numbers 1.11 through 2.21 depending on their credited experience and degree level in 86-87. It is important to note that these pay structure categories are built, in part, upon a program called the Peer Assistance and Review program previously agreed to by the parties. This program was designed to provide assistance to new teachers through mentors, i.e. , selected experienced teachers. The Intern and Resident Teacher categories are roughly analogous A probationary to what is commonly labeled probationary teachers. teacher is non-tenured and teachers in the Intern and Resident Teacher categories will also non-tenured. The difference is that a Resident Teacher might be tenured but not permanently certified, a condition precedent to achieving the Professional Teacher level, or permanently certified but not tenured. The specifications of lead teacher pay, lead teacher selection, and lead teacher duties are to be bargained by the parties over the next year, with any agreement subject to approval by each party. General guidelines on these matters are contained in the new agreement.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe agreement lists a variety of duties that may be assigned to lead teachers in two broad categories of instruction related or professional related functions: Consulting teachers in the PAR Internship and intervention program Adjunct faculty at schools of education in local colleges/universities CUrriculum specialists staff development specialists Test/exam specialists Research specialists Demonstration teachers The agreement only briefly describes the criteria to be considered in choosing a lead teacher: Evidence of professional growth Demonstrated outstanding classroom teaching ability Demonstrated effective written and oral communication skills Demonstrated ability to work cooperatively and effectively with other professional staff members Extensive knowledge on a variety of classroom management and instructional techniques The exact dimension and impact of these contractual guidelines are to be determined in the bargaining over the lead teacher position over the next eight months. As a general matter, the exact impact of st ruc tural changes in the way teachers are to be paid under the Rochester agreement, and the categories to which they are assigned (particularly the lead teacher position) , is difficult to ascertain at this point in time. The concepts contained in the new agreement may be harbingers of sign ificant change, or they may be simply shadow concep ts unlikely to be filled out in the bargaining to follow. It is not impossible that a monetary and qualifications gulf could arise between the Resident Teacher level and the Professional Teacher level over time and through successive rounds of\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nbargaining, thereby giving shape to the idea being offered by some reformers that the majority of teachers in the future should be \'low level drones supported by a few highly paid, superior professionals. This may be an area more critical to monitor than the lead teacher category. The avenue of development taken will depend on the internal politics of the RTA and the demographic changes likely in the teaching forces over the next three years. The new agreement is a signal for change, the exact dimension of which will play out over time with the self interest of the current teaching staff playing a critical and not easily disregarded role. Implementation of the Career Ladder A Joint District-Association Committee, co-chaired by the superin tendent of Schools and the Association President will \"determine the specific details of the Career in Teaching Plan\" subject to the approval of each party, \"establish operational procedures, develop all necessary forms and documents, and (and) selec t generally manage and the (sic) direct the program the Lead Teachers.\"\r\nâˆ‘ âˆ‘ âˆ‘\r\n\r\nSchool Site Decision Making The new agreement calls for the superintendent and the Association to \"cooperatively participate in the development of school based planning at each school location \" The RTA president has stressed in press reports that one has to see everything in the new agreement as fitting together in a grand design. In Education Week (Sept. 30, 1987) he was quoted as saying--IISo many things in this contract fit together Threatening the essence of any one of these major provisions is a threat to the entire endeavor\". The \"School Based Planning\" concept in the agreement is one of these major provisions in the eyes of the RTA, but aside from the contractual provision cited above there is no contractual explication of .the philosophical underpinnings to the school planning concept. This vagueness is no doubt calculated given the reactions of the administrators over the Peer Assistance and Review program. The administrators\' union, affiliated with the AFL-CIO, brought suit trying to block the program as a usurpation They received no of the functions of supervisors and managers. legal vindication, but obviously the superintendent is going to have move cautiously on similar matters in the future, and the school planning concept could be a real battle ground in the nex t year.\r\n. âˆ‘ âˆ‘ âˆ‘ âˆ‘ âˆ‘\r\n\r\nSeniority Press reports (see Education Week, Sept. 30, 1987) focus on the RTA giving up seniority as the determining factor in voluntary\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\ntransfer requests by teachers. In fact the RTA\'s giving u p seniority i n such situations i s i n the words of the agreement, \"contingent upon successful development of a mutually acceptable school based planning mode. \" Added Work Time In the 1988-89 school year Rochester teachers will work an additional three days above their current 185 day work year, and in the 1989-90 school year two more days bringing the teacher work year to one hundred and ninety days. Teacher Evaluation The evaluation article was changed in the new agreement by dropping reference to supervisors and administrators as teacher evaluators. The original agreement read: Evaluations and observations shall be made by adminis trative and supervisory personnel duly appointed by the Board of Education to a position which includes responsibilities for the evaluation and observation of Final evaluations of a teacher may be a result staff. -of one more observations conducted by one or more members of the City School District\'s administrative and supervisory staff. This passage has been changed to read: Evaluations and observations shall be made by personnel duly appointed by the Board of Education to a position which includes evaluation and observation of staff. Final observations must be based upon at least one or more observations conducted by one or more members of the city School District\' s staff. This may simply be a cleaning up prompted by the administrators\' law suit or it may be much more. Although no specific language, either in the contract or in press quotes of the principal parties, indicates any such development, one could speculate that this change of wording of the evaluation clause may be setting the stage for utilizing lead teachers in some teacher evaluation capacity, even beyond the current use of bargaining unit\'members as mentors under the Peer Assistance and Review program. Obviously a number of problems are posed by such a development. First, the RTA must convince its members that members can evaluate members, and second the Rochester administrators may see such a development as further teacher union intrusion into their job sphere\r\nâˆ‘ .\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nSalary FUnding By our estimates, the financial underpinnings of the RTA agreement are relatively solid due in part to the existence of a school fund surplus, the a bility of the superintendent to effect economies, and the predictability of school revenues and the economies that can be realized through the restructuring of teacher pay. In one press report, the Superintendent was quoted as saying that the cost of the proposed contract would be close to what a conventional contract would have cost if the district continued giving teachers automatic increases for seniority and extra education, plus a seven percent pay hike for each of the three years. One piece of datum we are missing is where teachers are placed on the 1986-87 salary schedule. This information would help us analyze the cost of the total package and ascertain directions likely to be taken in future rounds of bargaining.\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\nNEW Y ORK C I TY S ETT LEMENT Four things have been emphasized in the recent settlement of the New York teachers collective bargaining agreement which will be in effect over the next three years. These are: 1. 2. 3. The pay raise over the next three years;\r\nA \"School Based Option Plan\" allowing teachers to modify parts of the collective bargaining agreement;\r\n\r\nA \" Peer Intervention Program\" to assist teachers in performance difficulties; and A \" Professional Conciliation Plan\" designed to provide a vehicle for school faculties challenging administrative decisions.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nPay Raise A beginning BA degr ee teacher will get a 8.25 percent raise in 1987-88, a 6 . 24 percent raise in -88-89, and a 8. 7 percent raise in 89-90. The starting pay in 89-90 will be $25, 000. A MA +30 teacher with twenty years of experience will get a six percent raise in 1987-88, a 6.16 percent raise in 88-89, and a 9.17 percent raise in 89-90. This teacher will earn $50, 000 in 89-90.\r\n\r\n10\r\n...\r\n\r\nAl Shanker, in his \"Where We Stand\" column in the New York Times, September 13, .1987, noted that the \"salary range that the UFT achieved for the contract\'s third year is not the best in the New York metropolitan area, \" and that \"there is still a long way to go to make salaries competitive with neighboring areas\". School Based Option Plan This article allows the Union chapter in a school to modify provisions of the agreement on matters related to class size, rotation of assignments/classes, teacher schedules and/or rotation of paid coverages for the entire school year. Any modification must be agreed to by 75 percent of the school facul ty vo ting under procedures determined by the union AN D approved by the Union District Representative, the President of the Union, the appropriate Superintendent and the Chancellor. Modifications agreed to and approved can last only one year and canno t be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure in the agreement. This article is obviously an attempt to give school faculties some influence in school site decision making. How it works out in practice will depend on the receptivity of the school site administrator and t.he willingness of centralized union leadership to approve contract variations at the work site level. Peer In tervention Program Assistance will beâˆ‘ provided teachers who \"believe that their teaching competence will benefit from that assistance\". Participation is voluntary and confidential. The assistance process is contractually insulated. Intervening teachers (those assisting teachers re questing assistance) cannot be subpoenaed by the board or union in any proceeding, nor can an arbitrator accept evidence from an intervening teacher. This is somewha t like the Rochester Peer Assistance and Review Its success will depend on program but clearly more tentative. the quality of the intervening teachers selec ted and the confidence that can be built up over time in the efficacy of such a program. Professional Conciliation Plan In a selected number of areas (curriculum mandates, textbook selection, program offerings and scheduling, and student testing procedures and appraisal methodology) union school chapters may\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nrequest that a conciliation expert be selected to help resolve school faculty/administration disputes on these educational issues. It is a nonbinding process not subject to the grievance procedure, but the matters involved in such disputes may be subject to the grievance procedure. This is an attempt to provide third party intervention in work site disputes on selected matters. Along with the School Based Option feature, its success will depend on the willingness of the parties to utilize it in good faith and the skill of the conciliators selected. Both are seemingly serious efforts in a highly bureaucratic school system to give teachers a voice in critical matters at the work site level. They provide the framework for dialogue, but the decision making is still in the hands of the administration. It should be noted that the union as a It is only through the union plays a key role in both processes. local union chapter that school faculties can activate these processes. Summary All of the above can be judged to be modest gains. The raises are not what we would call breakthroughs. They are steady but modest In all probability, New York improvements in the pay of teachers. city teachers will probably be in the same relative position in 1990, vis-a-vis other comparable school districts, as they were in in 1986. The non-monetary aspects are even more odest. They are evolutionary, not revolutionary, attempts to openâˆ‘up school site decision making to teachers.\r\n\r\nJ D/RR/JF/pm\r\n\r\n'),(7236,68,2,50,0,'Analysis by the NEA of the Rochester Teachers Association Agreement and the New York City Settlement'),(5448,69,2,49,0,'Education Reform'),(5449,69,2,41,0,'Recommendations to the citizens and government of Florida concerning teacher compensation'),(5450,69,2,39,0,'Flordia Federation of Teachers'),(5451,69,2,48,0,'Teacher Compensation Working Group,.

We have spent the past year discussing and debating a variety of issues concerning Florida\'s educational system and the compensation of its school teachers. We came together with the hope that these discussions wou Id lead to a greater common understanding and sense of direction for Florida to pursue in improving the outcomes of its K-12 educational program. We believe we have made significant progress. The following document describes our work in three parts. First is a general set of recommendations concerning the many components we believe must be incorporated in any sufficient vision of the teacher compensation issue. This section also describes the problems we are addressing by placing emphasis on the compensation of teachers. The second part puts forth a framework for our Legislature, State Board of Education, Depart.ment of Education and sixty-seven local school districts to utilize in establishing performance based Career Development Programs to reward those teachers who demonstrate the initiative for professional development and enhanced performance. The third section communicates our recommendations concerning the allocation of resources to the areas identified in the first two parts. Th is section identifies three specific goals to be achieved by the 1986 Legislature. We hope you will consider our analysis of the problems Florida faces in ensuring appropriate instructional quality for its young people and support our sense af how to alleviate those problems through the judicious use of our pub lic revenues.\r\n\r\n;-:\'\r\n\r\n,.\r\n\r\nSICNATORIES\"\"\r\n\r\nJohn Gaines Executive Director\r\nFtori~a~.~n of School Administrators\r\n\r\nSteve Metz 4~ Vice President, Governmental A airs Florida Chamber of Commerce\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n\"-.:\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n~-----;\r\n\r\n-~-:--\r\n\r\nD.

Unlike many states, Florida has an elementary and secondary school student population that will continue to grow due to two factors: immigration and birth rate. This requirement of growth comes at a time when teaching has 9ecome a less attractive job option to our best and brightest high school graduates. Put simply, improving the quality of education we can give our young people depends on increasing the attractiveness .of the teaching profession in Florida. , One way we will have to do this is to increase 9Pportunity within the profession for monetary compensation. While we recognize money alone is not the sole reason individuals do or do not enter a teaching career, it is a component of the decision. Neither current entry salaries nor lifetime earning opportunities are sufficient to attract the quality of teachers we require. Across the board increases, alone, however, is not a sufficient solution to ,this problem. While it\'s true that many current teachers are underpaid for the quality of service they render, monetary incentives as a means of attracting and retaining teachers must be used selectively to assure that the highest quality personnel available are serving our children. What may be needed is a restructuring of our approach to compensation to reflect the reality of market conditions and natural variability of human performance aro initiative. To achieve th is objective, the report proposes nine specific recommendations addressed to the areas of base compensation, incentive compensation, recruitment and professionalism. It also proposes a detailed Professional Teacher Career Development Program. The report itself is brief. Therefore, we do not summarize its programatic proposals here. In general it calls for: market sensitive and professionally competitive levels of base compensation,supplemented by specific, incentive compensation programs\' that provide opportunity for a teacher to receive up to an additional one-th1rd of h is or her base pay for special efforts. Such a compensation structure, coupled with effective recruitment efforts and. improvements in school and classroom working conditions\"will increase the attractiveness and professionalism of teaching. Appropriate funding of the recommendations proposed will require several years to implement âˆ‘. The Career Development Program\' alone is anticipated to\r\n\r\ncost $,9o.M,t-ih\'its\'first-:Y~r\', incr~asingto-a- $330M cost in year five and \'Theomerproposalsalso require significant commitments of resources.\r\n\r\n, ser i005 resoi) rce\': constrciints; :under wh ich the I 986 ,I ~ is la f\'Jre js\' ,operati ng.

Therefore, we propose\' a sufficient portion of the revenues generated by revisions in our tax structure and current educational expenditures be established in a trust fund. This trust fund, for the improvement of teacher quality, is to be used to fund local actions consistent with the report\'s programatic . recommendations. To help ensure increased productivity accompanies these increased expenditures, we recommend a performance-based career development program, with characteristics equivalent to those proposed in our report, be passed by the Legislature this year--with local implementation scheduled, for fiscal\' year 198798. However,fhe program must carry assurances of funding during 1987 -88 at the levels sugge,sted as necessary, or it should not be implemented. Underfunded programs will not achieve the objectives we hold for improving the practice and professionalism of teach ing. In addition to appropriately funding incentive programs, baSe teacher compensation must be increased to market sensitive levels sufficient to attract the qUCllity of individuals necessary fo staff Florida\'S schools and to meet our enhanced certification standards. Therefore, we propose significant increases in both base teacher compensation and incentive compensation allocated so that after three years of implementation, incentive programs will constitute approximately 10% of our enhanced pool of total compensation dollars. To indicate a commitment to this approach we urge our Legislature to take action th is session to: I. -Fund increases in base compensation this year sufficient to enable our . . -teachers to rece ive -an--average-salary-i ncrease-at-the-Ieve-Is-atta ined--the-----past three years.\r\n\r\n\"\'-?\'~d:~};\'~}~~~~~~\':~:c~o\'m~\'erl\'d\'ation{fbr 1986\'ha~e been, te~per~ Jl,reflect the\r\n\r\n.\"\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nFund the Quality Instruction Incentives Trust Fund sufficient to a) meet our obligations to those teachers currently designated as Associate Master Teachers, b) provide a payment of $3;000 to those\'who are to be designated Associate Master teachers as a result of th is year\'s p\'rogram procedures; and, c)\' provide adequate incentive for\' ou( teachers and school boards to continue their participation in . the Merit Schools Program. ii\r\n\r\nr\r\n\r\n,,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\'.\r\n\r\n. .. \"\'?\':\'~~. \' \'. \' .\r\n\r\n~.;:~;~:: P;aSÃŸ;dP~rformance-bc:ised \'Career~ Development Program wh ich ensures ;\'\\d~,\\,âˆ‘t~afâˆ‘ funding available- in 1987-88 will support and motivate full\r\n;i;5;\"f~::participation\r\nr\'\\\'\r\n\r\nof our teachers and local school districts.

As our\r\n\r\nState strives to improve the quality of education available to all our young people we commonly recognize improvement of instructional quality to be the single most important element of that effort. Instructional quality is a direct function of the quality of the teachers meeting our children every day. We believe teacher quality to be relative to many factors: a fair and reasonable compensation schedule, inc luding elements that reward performance; standards for entry to training and to practice; periodic and appropriate evaluation and professional development; opportunities for advancement and additional responsibility; a professional env ironment in wh ich to work. The recommendations that follow are intended to utilize the -policy making role of state government to create a structure within which the characteristics just described are most likely to continue to emerge witf{in Florida\'s sixty-seven different school districts. While we believe ultimately that educational\r\n\r\nproblems should be identified and resolved at thegov~rnmentallevel closest to them, (j.e., the local school and district), we recognize th~t the State has\'the responsibility to\r\n\r\n-2-.\r\nse t\r\n\r\nstaridardS!\\.9\"d;~,prqVide\'~;;~~,opportun~t~âˆ‘,f9r;\":lOCQIL resp~~~s.\r\n:\",<~,:.\r\n\r\nTherefore;:\' :~erev~rr:\' .\r\n\r\npossible\' our recommendations follow such a model. \' . -, . .\r\n.. _. âˆ‘ âˆ‘ ,\" .,\' \" .. ~\r\n~,\r\n\r\nThe following pages describe our.\r\n.âˆ‘ âˆ‘ ,\r\n\r\nsense of the most significant problem., facingH~u!=ational.improvement, in F.!orid~\'and our\r\nf ; .\' ,\" .\". v; \',,:\r\n\r\nrecC?mmendati,ons for its alleviation.

Unlike many states, Florida has an elementary\r\n\r\nand secondary school student population that will continue to grow due to\' two factors: immigration and birth rate. Nationally, our baby boomer\'s babies are beginning to enter the public schools~ This will result in a tighter market as over one million teachers will be sought to fill new classrooms over the next eight years. multiplied by our annual population growth due to immign?tion. new students were in our schools. teachers it current Iy .need~annually. states.

Meeting both the educational\r\n\r\nneeds of our children and .the infrastructure needs of our growing population require immediate action. We believe it is important for Florida to recognize that our most\r\n\r\nsignificant infrastructure resource is not our roads, schools, jails, or hospitals, but is rather our people. It is our people who will build the Florida of the future. Therefore,\'\r\n\r\ninvestments in the growth and development of our people must lead any investment in infrastructure.

Further, review of other\r\n\r\nspecific programs concerning their contribution to instructional quality should be ongoing.

Current base salary schedules are structured around the employees\' level of education and years of experience., They provide compensation for up to four levels of education and in some cases up to 30 years of experience. The result is an unduly long period of time for a teacher to achieve maximum salary and probably an inappropriate reflection of the value of simple experience over other factors. Therefore, we\r\n\r\nrecommend a program of incentives to school districts to assist them to comore\'ss salary schedules to reflect a 7-10 step experience comoonent covering an 8-12 year span of experience. Opportunities for additional compensation above these levels cou Id come\r\n\r\nfrom cost-of-living adjustments and from financial incentives to reflect the assumption of additional responsibilities or spec ial conditions assoc iated iNith the teach ing\r\n\r\nassignment or from financial incentives for exceptional performance.\r\n\r\nIncentives: Monetary incentives as a supplement to basic compensation are intended to provide an opportunity for those teachersâˆ‘who ,wish to distinguishâˆ‘ themselvesirf;some manner beneficial to their employers and students to earn, addition\'a/ compensotioi;\' fbi \'that effort.

The following recommendations are intended to provide a full range\' of all three types, of incentive opportunities for Florida teachers to enhance their basic compensation.\r\n(I) Florida faces teacher \'shortages in many subject areas. Foremost among these\r\n\r\nare math and science instruction as well as special education.\r\n\r\nSoon elementary school\r\n\r\nand English teachers may be in short supply. In addition there are specific schools \'Nhich, âˆ‘ due to circumstances of their location, are difficult to appropriately staff. We\r\n\r\n,recommend districts recruit teachers to these shortage areas by offering incentives such as placement at levels on the salary schedule in excess of the actual experience of the teacher or as direct cash increments for such service. (2) While the basic compensation schedule must provide an adequate salary for satisfactory teaching performance and workload, there must also be opportunities within the teaching profession for highly motivated individuals to continually find and meet new challenges as they grow professionally. The basic function of teaching is to instruct\r\n\r\nstudents. However, there are other roles teachers also play within the profession as they engage in actions that have impact beyond their own classroom. These ment,oring,\r\n\'f\r\n\r\nassisting, evaluating, planning and designing roles can be formalized and financial incentives associated with their successful performance. The result would be aC9.~eer\r\n\r\ndevelopment program which provides opportunity for the professional and financial growth of a significant percentage of those who choose ,teaching, as;,a Iife~il11e cqreer âˆ‘\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n-8There\':are.âˆ‘.\r\n\r\n. , . \"\"\'fJ~;[t{{;>~\'i,; ...... ,\"\r\nâˆ‘;\":\'fâˆ‘\" .,\r\n\r\ni,~.i~yi;,âˆ‘~sp~tSOf\r\n\r\nteaching curreriiiy under review within\r\n\r\nLegislature~~i>gf.ftce.\',of the Governor, and Department\' of Education.\r\n\r\n.\' . ...... .\"\r\n\r\nFlo~ida âˆ‘by{~lth~~,âˆ‘~/,\r\nThese in~olve.\r\n\r\n<\")\'\"\r\n\r\n..\'\r\n\r\n......\r\n\r\nteacti~r comp~sation, performan~e ev6Iuci\'t\'i~\' and âˆ‘certâˆ‘i\'fication.

As the current decade draws to a close, Florjda has remaining a brief opp\'ortunity to attract experienced teachers from those states that are still experiencing declining enrollments in the upper grades. An immediate and concrete effort should be made to\r\n~ring\r\n\r\nto Florida high quality experienced teachers from the northeast and north central\r\n\r\nregions of the country. To increase school distric\'ts\' ability to do this we recommen\'d the Legislature take action to I) permit school boards to pay moving excenses for out of \'state teachers gualified in critical shortage areas, 2) clarify the ability of school boards to pay for interview related travel and expenses of prospective employees and personnel officials on recruitment ,trips, 3) allow experienced\r\nout~f-state\r\n\r\nteachers to Durchase\r\n\r\nretirement credit in the Florida retirement system for their previous excerience., The Legislature should review the Florida retirement system in its entirety and amend the system by updating benefits that will retain and attract teachers. We also encourage\r\n\r\nlocal school districts to consider providing full salary schedule credit for out of state experience as a means of recruiting experienced teachers. While selectively recruiting experienced teachers will enhance instructional\r\n\r\nquality, the majority of our future need for teachers will be met by the employment of inexperienced or new teachers.. The key, to quality enhancement,. therefore, is to increase .the quality of the pool of young people attracted to teaching as\r\n\r\nq, career.

Xerox executive Nathan B. Winstanley, for one. Winstanley posed the question in a recent issue of Personnel Administrator, adding that \"even though a merit pay system is difficult (or all but impossible) to administer, it is a nice thing in which to believe.\" Noted industrial psychology researcher Herbert H. Meyer is another. \"Despite the apparent soundness of the simple principle on which merit pay is based, experience tells us that it does not always work out with such elegant simplicity,\" Meyer wrote in \"The Payfor-Performance Dilemma,\" an article in Organizational Dynamics. \"In our society, it is difficult to argue with the proposition that higher performance deserves higher pay,\" A. Mikalachki argued in The Business Quarterly. \"The paradox of this system is that most white-collar workers want merit pay until they get it, and then they do not want it at all.\" The business world, like education, has had a -long experience with pay-for-performance plans, dating back to the turn of the century. But while there is very little empirical research on such programs in school settings, there is a broad research base in business and industry. Early research was glowing about the theoretical possibilities of merit pay, but more recent studies have shown that a great many plans do not work out in practice the way they do on paper. Yet some plans are more effective than others at motivating employees and increasing productivity. One of the keys that is most effective in unlocking resistance to merit pay is. employee participation, research has shown. The same plan can succeed or fail\r\n\r\nL\r\n\r\n-i I\r\n.\\\r\n\r\nI\r\nI\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nl\r\n-I\r\n\r\nl\r\nA j\r\n\r\ndepending on the degree of staff participation in planning, writes Edward Lawler in \"Participation and Pay,\" which appeared in Compensation Review. âˆ‘\'When workers participate in the design and administration of a system, they are more likely to trust it for two reasons: They have more information about it, and they perceive they have control over what happens,\" Lawler says. In addition, partiCipation leads to feelings of ownership, and this leads people to view the plan as fair, he said. Other researchers have found that trust is the one element most often missing when management decides to implement a merit pay system. Yet Lawler, one of the most respected authorities in the field, suggests that the best way to solve that problem is to let employees participate in the design of the plan. \"What better indication of the seriousness of an organizational development effort and of the trustworthiness of management is there than for management to turn over pay administration to employees?\" Lawler asks. \"It can provide dramatic proof to employees that management is \'for real\' when it talks about participation and that it trusts them to handle a very important facet of organization existence.\" EVELOPING A pay-for-performance plan is deceptively difficult, because pay is one dimensional while human behavior is multidimensional. In designing a plan, it is necessary to define precisely what aspects of performance are to be evaluated and what levels are acceptable-and this is much easier said than done. If employees are to accept such a plan, they must feel that the standards are fair, that the evaluation is carried out impartially, and that stanâˆ‘ dards will not be continuously raised beyond theil grasp-another tall order. \"Success or failure of a system depends very large!)\r\nWINTER\r\n\r\nD\r\n\r\nDaphne Siev White is an assistant editor in the AFT editorial department.\r\nS I AMERICAN EDUCATOR\r\n\r\n198:\r\n\r\non acceptance of the criteria established, and that\'s more difficult than we think,\" Meyer says. \"Even in sales, where objective measurements are possible, it is hard to agree on what is expected.\" Management tends to set very high standards, while employees want to\r\n\r\nlower the standards as much as possible so they can achieve a merit raise, he says. If it is difficult to agree on standards in sales and manufacturing, it should not be surprising that school boards and teachers have trouble reaching a consensus on evaluation methods. \"Research on effective teaching tells us that there is not one best system of instruction, \" says Rand Corporation researcher Linda Darling-Hammond. \"No one has discovered the set of teacher attributes that promotes student learning.\" Teaching is an art as well as a science, and \"a behavior that is effective when used in moderation can produce significant and negative results when used too much or-as others have found-when applied in the wrong circumstances,\" Darling-Hammond et al. said in their recent review of the literatur\'e on teacher evaluation. \"This kind of finding makes it difficult to develop rules. for teaching behaviors that can be generally applied.\" Because of the problems associated with defining what makes an effective or outstanding teacher, it is even more difficult to design an evaluation tool that can rate teachers and compare one to another. As Paul Thompson and Gene Dalton put it in the Harvard Business Review, .. An organization or even a group requires a carefully coordinated set of widely different technical and social skills and abilities to operate effectively. Each individual contributes a rich combination not necessarily correlated with performance. For the most part, the really significant rewards come through promotions, and the really outstanding people rise up the ladder rather than move up in salary in the same grade level.\" HE \"SIMPLE elegance\" of merit pay fades rapidly when exposed to the workaday world precisely because people and their motivations are so very complex. For example, a merit pay plan designed to reward the better workers and send a message to less productive workers often leaves everyone feeling that they didn\'t get what they deserve, Meyer said. In a study that has become a classic in its field, Meyer showed that 90 percent of workers in a General Electric plant felt their performance level was in the top 50 percent, and further studies with accountants showed that 37 percent of them felt they were in the top 10 percentile. \"The fact that almost everyone thinks he is an\r\n10 I\r\nAMERICAN EDUCATOR\r\n\r\nabove-average performer probably lies at the root of most of our problems with merit pay plans,\" Meyer wrote. \"Since the salary increases most people get do not reflect superior performance (as determined by interpersonal comparisons or as defined in the guidelines for the pay plan), the effects of the actual pay increases on motivation are likely to be more negative than positive. The majority feel discriminated against because it appears that management does not recognize their true worth.\" The negative effects of some merit pay plans include employee stress, subversion of long-term company goals for short-term personal gains, loss of significance for any reward except merjt pay, competition among colleagues who are supposed to be working together, . and serious morale problems. Because of this dilemma, researchers in both business and education are urging adoption of plans such as differentiated staffing and career ladders rather than one-dimensional, win-lose systems like merit pay. For in reality, most companies that claim to have merit pay plans wind up giving the majority of employees very similar pay increases, \"and these increases are not necessarily correlated with performance,\" Meyer says. He agrees that in most companies the really significant rewards come through promotions and not merit increases. \"Every organization, certainly every large organization, should have well-defined hierarchies of positions through which individuals can advance. Such advancement opportunities should be available to as high a percentage of members of the organization as possible, \" Meyer has written. \"Most promotions would probably involve moving up to positions within one\'s function that are more complex or that involve higher levels of responsibility and more important decisions. The outstanding accountant, salesman, technician, engineer, and so on is often much more valuable to the organization for his technical contributions than for his supervisory or managerial skills.\" NOTHER ARGUMENT for advancement through promotion is the fact that promotional decisions are made much more carefully than merit pay decisions, Meyer said. Such findings are supported by researchers in the education community. \"I have never seen any evidence that shows merit pay promotes excellence in teaching,\" said Gary Sykes, former head of the teaching policies team at the National Institute of Education. The best way to reward outstanding teachers is to offer them expanded responsibilities and opportunities to develop professionally, he says. Darling-Hammond agrees. \"One of the greatest intrinsic rewards for teachers is to give them the autonomy to do what they think is best for their students,\" she says. But the accountability movement (concerned with the removal of incompetent teachers) has tied the hands of the competent majority and is preventing them from having the independence of judgment enjoyed by most professionals. Teacherproof curricula, teaching to tests, and other accountability measures are taking much of the joy out of teaching, she says.\r\nWINTER\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n1983\r\n\r\nYet it was the anticipation of helping students and making an individual contribution that brought many teachers into the profession. In his classic study, Schoolteacher, Dan Lortie found that the \"psychic,\" intrinsic rewards of teaching were more important to teachers than payor convenient scheduling. The recent Carnegie Foundation study High School, by Ernest Boyer, also recommends improving the conditions of teaching, rewarding and recognizing outstanding teachers publicly, and creating a career path for teachers in addition to increasing teacher pay. The best reward for teachers is to let them become as competent as they can be and to remove those impediments-discipline problems, frequent interruptions, excessive paperwork-that make good teaching difficult, Sykes says. Setting up an evaluation plan that would help teachers become more effective-rather than one designed to weed out incompetent teachers-could have beneficial side effects. \"The process of developing evaluation systems is an occasion for many things in an organization, such as the interaction of constituencies, celebration of important values, and joint recognition of problems,\" wrote M.S. Knapp in his book Toward the Study of Teacher Evaluation as an Organizational Process. \"Whether or not performance objectives are met by a specified proportion of a school district\'s teachers, the indirect results of such efforts may have considerable impact on staff enthusiasm, beliefs or behavior, with ultimate benefits for students.\" However, any evaluation plan must be set up carefully and with a particular goal in mind-one plan should not be used for multiple goals. A fascinating study by Michael Gallagher showed that the results of a performance evaluation were very much influenced by the stated goal of the review. When three groups evaluated the same videotaped performance of a faculty member teaching a class, the group told that the professor was to be punished (put on-probation, laid off, or immediately dismissed) rated him higher than the group that was told he was to be rewarded (promoted, given tenure, or a salary in-\r\n\r\nformance evaluation should not be used for different purposes, since the stated purpose of the evaluation can affect the actual performance rating,\" Gallagher says. For example, an appraisal made to determine the need for additional training may emphasize a person\'s weakness in a particular area to justify the training, but that same appraisal should not be used in salary or layoff decisions, he stresses. \"The only solution to this problem .. .is to conduct different kinds of performance evaluations for different purposes,\" Gallagher concludes. Yet a recent NIE study of thirty-two school districts in twenty-four states shows that a majority of the districts use one evaluation tool for four goals-personnel decisions, staff development, school improvement, and accountability, although different districts attach different priorities to each of the goals. \"How realistic is that expectation?\" asks Milbrey Wallin Mclaughlin, who conducted the study. \"Can a single evaluation system address all four purposes equally well?\" VALUATIONS THAT tend to work the best are those that focus on future performance, with the staff member and supervisor setting goals together, rather than focusing on past actions. The much-quoted General Electric study showed that criticism of past performance had a negative effect on goal achievement, while praise of past performance had little effect on achieving future goals. \"The more criticism a man received in the performance appraisal discussion, the more defensively he reacted,\" the researchers found. And the more defensive an employee felt, the more his performance deteriorated. On the other hand, \"one of the most significant findings in our experiment was the fact that far superior results were observed when the manager and the man together set specific goals to be achieved, rather than merely discussed needed improvement,\" Meyer et aI., concluded. In some cases, peer review has worked better than appraisal by a superior and has \"often proved to be more effective in relating pay to performance than the typical one-on-one superior-subordinate pay administration decision process,\" Lawler reports. Peers have better information and, when they are properly trained, can make better judgments than the supervisor can alone, Lawler adds. Meyer agrees, saying that \"research shows evaluations done by peers often have more validity than evaluations done by superiors.\" Those doing the evaluations-whether they are peers or supervisors-must be trained to do ratings based on objective criteria and to be as bias free as possible. \"The evaluator is the most important part of the evaluation instrument,\" Gallagher says. The evaluator is just as much a factor in the rating process as the person being evaluated because, just as in the Olympics, the same performance can garner different scores from different judges. For that reason, it is of crucial importance to carefully select and train evaluators, Gallagher says. One way to get away from peer competition is to im(Continued on page 42)\r\nAMERICAN EDUCATOR I\r\n\r\nE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nI !\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\ncrease). The control group, which was not told the purpose of the evaluation, rated him midway between the other two groups . Those evaluators who were told that the faculty member was to be punished rated him highly in order to keep him from being penalized, while those who were told he would be rewarded gave him lower grades to keep him from getting the increase, Gallagher concluded in Personnel magazine. \"The results of this study indicate that a single perWINTER\r\n\r\n1983\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nCAN MERIT PAY WORK?\r\n\r\n(Continued from page 11)\r\nplement a system of group rewards. Group incentive plans have been more effective than individually based incentive payments in many instances, reports Bruce Ellig in Compensation Review. And \"peer expectations can have a powerful impact on performance,\" David Belcher notes in the same publication. \"One expert, in fact, found that peer expectations acted as a better predictor of grades in accounting than did the expectancy that high effort would result in good grades. In an employment relationship, the social contact could be expected to be even more powerfuL\" HATEVER EVALUATION system is selected by a school district, teachers must understand what tasks they are responsible for, the criteria by which they will be evaluated, what data will be collected, and how the rating system works, says education researcher Gary Natriello. Finally, teachers must get feedback from the evaluation process (something that is not now done by many districts), and they should be given the opportunity to discuss with an administrator a plan to strengthen their weaknesses and\r\n\r\nW\r\n\r\nimprove their teaching. The more specific the suggestions on this score, the better, Natriello says: A district should be able to provide teachers with. inservice education or point them to specific college courses. Natriello has been studying the only school district in the country that has had a merit pay plan in effect for thirty years: Ladue, Missouri. Some of the reasons the system has lasted this long, he says, are that teachers help develop the criteria by which administrators rate them; administrators are given extensive training in evaluation and this task is an integral part of their jobs; principals are held accountable by their supervisors for the degree to which their reports are based on the stated criteria; and teachers do get feedback and suggestions for improvement. The researchers say their study is not yet far enough along to tell whether teachers in Ladue are satisfied with this plan-but they have found that most teachers consider the plan objective. Ladue is a wealthy, predominantly white suburban school district, however, and the lessons learned there may not apply to other districts, Sykes warns. \"The moral of the story is that performance-based pay is not for everyone or every situation,\" Lawler says. Meyer predicted that if a merit pay plan were to be mandated on a statewide level, \"it could be disastrous.\" When plans are imposed from above, they almost invariably fail and are abandoned after a few years, he says. A merit pay plan should involve as many people as possible in its development, the procedure should be pilot tested, and only then should the plan be implemented \"slowly and carefully,\" Meyer says. When dealing with mice, one researcher said, all that is necessary to get them to run differently is to move the cheese around. But when trying to motivate human beings, merely moving the cheese around may not be sufficient. 0\r\n\r\nl\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\nRESOURCE LIST\r\nThe fonowing references were cited in this article: Belcher, David, \"Pay and Performance,\" Compensation Review, Third Quarter, 1980 Darling-Hammond, Linda, Wise, Arthur and Pease, Sara, \"Teacher Evalution in the Organizational Context: A Review of the Literature,\" The Review of Educationa.l Research, Fall, 1983 Ellig, Bruce, \"Pay Inequities: How Many Exist Within Your Organization?\" Compensation Review, Third Quarter, 1980 Gallagher, Michael, \"More Bias in Performance Evaluation?\" Personnel, July/August, 1978 Knapp, M.S.

Where is the \"best\" incentive program for teachers? The answers to these questions will vary depending on whether you ask a legislator in a state with funding problems, a teacher who is earning an additional $7,000 because of a career ladder program, the president of a teachers\' organization opposing a particular incentive program, or an enthusiastic school principal who supports a district or state plan. One fact is clear. Career ladder and other incentive pay programs are the largest educational experiment in the United States today. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being\' spent, and hundreds of thousands of teachers and school administrators are part of state and local incentive programs to reward teachers and administrators for doing a better job or for taking on additional responsibilities in schools. Leadership, teacher support, funding, and evaluating programs for outcomes and effectiveness continue to be key points for discussion. The fact that teachers say they really like or they really dislike the programs may signal change beginning to take place in schools. A report of preliminary findings from a comprehensive outside evaluation of Utah\'s Career Ladder System (now in its fourth year) states: \"Teachers and principals have very strong feelings about Career Ladders. They either love [the idea] or they hate it. Our interpretation is that ... it is a major reform which is affecting the climate of the schools in a powerful way ... changing both the instructional and management processes in the schools.\" A similar phenomenon is seen in North Carolina\'s Charlotte-Mecklenburg program. There, the superintendent claimed he receives five letters a day from teachers who threaten to quit because of the career development program, but at the same time he said, \"Many teachers continue to say it\'s outstanding, and the single-most important contribution to their professional development.\" There is an important message in the Utah consultant evaluation and the CharlotteMecklenburg superintendent\'s observation-career ladders deal with fundamental changes. Fundamental changes in any situation-in business, in government, or in the schools-make for strong reactions. These strong reactions should not be seen by educational and governmental leaders as a sign of a fatal flaw in incentive programs. Perhaps to the contrary. If there were no strong reactions to an incentive program as it was implemented, that would signal that the program was bringing about no real change and was dealing with important issues only at the surface. States and school districts should weigh negative reactions and suggestions for modifications in their plans that may spring from this dissatisfaction. In some states career ladders may be as controversial today as in 1984 when legislation made Tennessee the first state to establish a statewide program. But, in 1987, no state backed away from a career ladder program that was underway. Iowa has just provided over $92 million in new money for teachers-$43 million will go to districts that develop incentive programs. In states such as Texas and Utah, where cuts in education were made, funding for career ladder programs was not reduced in 1987. Pilot projects in North Carolina and South Carolina continue to expand. Some states-Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, and New Mexico, for example-that have not\r\nSummary prepared by Lynn M.

Legislative sessions in 1988 will determine the future of many programs. The Alabama legislature will decide whether to fund the career ladder (initial funding went to develop the evaluation process). Prospects for full funding of the career ladder appear dim. Kentucky and Virginia funded one- and two-year pilot projects but have not committed beyond that.\r\n\r\nLeadership and Support\r\n\"How much time is needed to develop consensus as well as workable programs?\"\r\nCareer Ladder Clearinghouse, July 1985\r\n\r\n\" . .. the public must support these changes for several years if it expects to see real changes.\"\r\nJay Robinson, Former Superintendent, Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District, March 1986 How much time does it take to develop support or consensus for a program? How much time does it take to determine if a plan is working or achieving its intended goals? The answer is more time. That answer is based on the results of three or four years of experience with these new career ladder and incentive programs. The more important question is: Will leadership and support be sustained long enough for a fair test to determine if the programs are meeting their intended goals? Initial support came from state boards of education, governors, legislators, and the public. Less enthusiastic voices were heard from many educators-teachers\' organizations, in particular. Leadership for educational reform was centered in state capitals. That leadership is necessary but not sufficient. Principals, teachers, and parents must be part of change if it is to be fundamental, lasting change. Many governors and legislators who promoted reform are no longer in office. Newly-elected officials have their own agendas and may not have the same vision of reform as their predecessors. Leadership at the district level is taking different forms. In Fairfax County, Virginia, the superintendent and board of education proposed and put into place a new incentive program for teachers. The new school superintendent in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina, school district (a district that had one of the first career development plans) supports the continuance of the program and has appointed an advisory committee to make recommendations on changes needed to refine that district\'s program. Consultants evaluating the South Carolina Teacher Incentive Program found that superintendents and local boards generally support that state\'s programs. The recent report on Kentucky\'s Career Ladder Pilot Program noted that local district leadership was the determining factor in whether or not teachers were used effectively under extended employment plans. Local chapters of the American Federation of Teachers, such as those in Toledo, Ohio, and Rochester, New York, have taken the initiative in working with local school districts to develop career development programs. In other state programs, such as those in California, Iowa, and Wisconsin, the locally-designed programs must be joint efforts involving the teachers\' organization. In Alabama, the Alabama Education Association, which by law is involved in the designing of the program, has been supportive of the implementation of the evaluation process that was the first phase of a proposed career ladder program. General support from state teachers\' organizations has varied. In locally-negotiated career ladder plans, the emphasis is on extra pay for extra duties or different duties, as opposed to other plans that provide bonuses for teachers who demonstrate a higher level of performance within an existing teaching position. (The review of the South Carolina program found that teachers preferred incentives based on performance over assuming extra duties, leading to change in that program.) In Utah, extended employment (all teachers working extra days, etc.) can take 50 percent of . the funding. It currently accounts for only 40 percent -less than when the program was initiated several years\'ago; 60 percent goes to performance bonuses and steps on the ladder. (These decisions in the Utah program are made at the district level.)\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nFunding \"Incentive programs are expensive . .. funding over the long term must be assured.\"\r\nCareer Ladder Clearinghouse, July 1985 Funding patterns for 1987-88 generally remained at about the same level as for the previous year. Full funding of a statewide program continues in Tennessee and Texas. Tennessee is spending nearly $100 million in 1987-88; Texas, second only to California in number of classroom teachers, has budgeted several hundred million dollars. Some states-Arizona, California, North Carolina, and South Carolina-continue to increase funding to allow expansion to additional teachers. North Carolina is at $16 million, up from $12 million; the South Carolina Teacher Incentive Program went from $6 million to $11.9 million (school incentive program funding is now at $4 million-down from $6 million-and funding for the Principal Incentive Program increased from $700,000 to $1 million). Money for the California Mentor Teacher Program continues to in. crease-from $30.8 million in 1984-85 to $49.75 million in 1987-88. In Missouri, career ladder funding increased to $8.0 million from $2.6 million a year ago; Arizona\'s plan is now at $8.8 million compared to $4 million in 1986-87. Funding remained the same in Utah ($41 million) despite other funding cuts for education. Iowa has just put $92 million new dollars into recruiting and retaining quality teachers; $43 million will go to districts for incentive programs. Kentucky and Virginia funded one- and two-year pilot projects, but it does not appear likely that state funding will be provided for additional programs. States that have not committed funds-Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, and New Mexico-have the same budget problems as a year ago and probably will not fund new programs. Funding for the Florida Career Achievement Program has not been forthcoming. (According to the law, $90 million must be appropriated by the end of the 1988 legislative session or the program will be repealed.) Indiana funded its teacher quality pilot programs at $6 million for 1985-87 and provided $4 million for disseminating information and providing training and support to districts implementing plans in 1987-89. Career ladder plans require substantial funding, especially as higher levels on the ladder are phased in. Long-term commitment of money will be necessary. Incentive programs have tended to be controversial and, therefore, one of the first items to be suggested for budget cuts. Thus far, however, where programs are underway they have not usually been subject to budget reductions. Legislative sessions in 1988 will signal states\' intentions for continuing or expanding programs.\r\n\r\nEvaluation \"The success or failure of the career ladder concept may rest in fair selection systems that do not evolve into expensive bureaucratic procedures at the state and local level. \"\r\nCareer Ladder Clearinghouse, July 1985\r\n\r\n\"The more difficult task-and one that is essential for successful performance-based career plans-is the development of an evaluation system that is fair and is perceived as fair. \"\r\nCareer Ladder Clearinghouse, March 1985 A South Carolina study found that 60 percent of the teachers not involved in its Teacher Incentive Program perceive themselves to be in the top 20 percent of teachers in their districts. Therefore it should not be surprising that implementing any evaluation system which is designed to determine excellence will be perceived as not fair by a large number of teachers. Teachers may accept the bell-shaped curve for students, but many apparently do not accept it . for themselves. That there are many good teachers and fewer who are incompetent or excellent is not a concept accepted by teachers, according to what many teachers are saying. Teachers also say they dislike competition for awards (competition leads to teachers being labeled as \"good\" or \"excellent\"). In the same South Carolina study, teachers noted competition as a major reason for not partiCipating in the program. A report of a project at Appalachian State University in North Carolina to define the role of master teachers and discuss their preparation and evaluation stated\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nthat, \"implementing a master-teacher program requires a commitment to the reality that differences exist in life, that they are recognized and rewarded differently .... The prevailing mind-set must shift from seeing the problems of master-teacher delineation to seeing the possibilities ... \" There is no question that teacher evaluation is changing-peer review, classroom observations, and use of student achievement are replacing ratings by principals. Questions still remain. Will statewide procedures work? What are the problems in implementing evaluation equitably across several districts? Will district-designed procedures satisfy those supporting state funding for programs? While early career ladder and incentive programs were to a large degree centralized at the state level, states establishing more recent programs are using more local involvement and control. However, where districts were originally given free reign in designing evaluation procedures, more structure is now evident. Districts in many of those states are asking for more technical help in developing evaluation procedures. States and districts are refining procedures as programs move into the second or third years. No ideal teacher evaluation model has evolved, nor is a single one likely, but practice is providing directions for change. In South Carolina, the third-party evaluation revealed that teachers (both those who applied for the program and those who did not) agreed that student achievement, administrator evaluations, and performance evaluations should be used equally to decide on bonuses for superior performance and productivity. Working additional hours, attendance, and self-improvement were said to be less important, according to the survey. This year\'s program changes the weighting of bonus pOints to more clearly reflect performance. (Now, 40 of the 50 bonus points are awarded for performance evaluation and documented student achievement.) In addition, the South Carolina incentive model, which depended heavily on assuming work and extra duties and/or activities outside the classroom, is being phased out. Based on site visits of these programs, which depend on district-designed evaluation procedures, consultants noted that the process for observing performance was weak and that technical assistance was needed to train observers and develop evaluation procedures. Districts also needed help in managing and implementing their plans. During 1986-87, the South Carolina Department of Education and the University of South Carolina developed a manual for districts. The manual, \"Teacher Performance Evaluation,\" outlines how to plan and develop an evaluation process, with guidelines on how to collect data and monitor the evaluation procedures. The North Carolina Career Development Program has completed two years of a four-year pilot project. A study of the implementation of the statewide evaluation system shows that there is wide variation across districts in terms of numbers of teachers who have been placed on career levels I and II-in one district, 49 percent of the teachers were placed on level II; in another district, 84 percent. A common understanding of the criteria and their value may not exist statewide or differences may be real across districts, according to studies by the State Department of Education. Preliminary data indicate that errors are made in rating teacher performance. The data show that evaluators are not consistent in assessing criteria that are not easily observable in the classroom. Lesson planning, interactions with colleagues and parents, and noninstructional school and district duties tend to receive higher ratings than ones that are drawn from \"research\" and can be observed in the classroom. The conclusion is that when less direct evidence is available, teachers tend to receive higher ratings. More training on these competencies and the rating of them has been mandated. The overall conclusions by the State Department of Education after two years of the project are that the total system is working, and the hard work of superintendents, principals, teachers, and evaluators has been critical in the success of the program. The evaluation procedures for the Alabama Career Incentive Program have been developed and will be implemented statewide during 1987-88. This program features a teacher performance evaluation that relies on administrators observing teachers in the classroom. A recent independent study reported by the State Department of Education shows that the Alabama evaluation program has approval of over 75 percent of the participants. The immediate effects are seen as the establishment of a consistent statewide vocabulary on classroom behavior and instructional goals and the fact that principals now regularly visit classrooms. (In the past, 50 percent of the state\'s principals supervised teachers without any formal methods.) According to program consultants, in Alabama, teachers have probably played a larger role in developing the statewide system than in any other state.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe Texas Teacher Appraisal System was implemented during 1986-87 to place teachers on the career ladder. (Local evaluations developed by individual districts were used the first two years.) Approximately 13,000 administrators and teachers were trained as appraisers in the summer of 1986. Proficiency checks and additional training were given in 1987. During 1986-87, an advisory group for the State Board of Education and a committee appointed by the governor recommended revisions in the appraisal process. Some items were combined, others eliminated, scoring was changed, and teacher self-appraisal and professional development plans were simplified. The 1987 legislature reduced the number of annual observations from four to two for teachers at Career Level II or higher who have received performance scores exceeding expectations. Grade chairpersons are now allowed to observe teachers in their own school. (The original law did not allow teachers to be appraised by a teacher in the same building.) In Tennessee, career ladder teachers initially received certification for five yearsl that has now been extended to ten. Findings from the 1986-87 Kentucky pilot project to design and test an evaluation process for a proposed career ladder program (the length of the pilot was reduced from two years to one due to fiscal problems) showed that the evaluation system could identify quality teaching and produce a reasonable range of ranking of teachers. Data included information from classroom observations, a discussion with the teacher about planning, and the teacher\'s ability to set and achieve goals in professional development. The project found that evaluation teams of an administrator andpeer, a teacher and state observer, or three state observers were all within acceptable ranges of consistency in their assessment of teacher behaviors. According to the State Department of Education, the Utah Career Ladder Program, now in its fourth year, has helped the districtâˆ‘designed evaluation systems to continue to improve with time. The districts are using many more kinds of evidence, such as principal evaluation, peer evaluation, student progress, student surveys, and parental input. Legislation in 1987 further specifies that joint committees of educators and school board appointees in each district design evaluation procedures; the legislation outlines criteria to be included. Originally, when programs started, all districts used different evaluation procedures. Now, four evaluation methods (based on effective schools research) are used by all the districts in the state. Two-thirds of the districts revised proâˆ‘ cedures during the first year of the Career Ladder Program. The recent third-party evaluation of the Utah Career Ladder Plan states that principals now have increased responsibilities for evaluation. Teachers in Utah, according to the study, believe that the career ladder program has been most effective in providing more frequent teacher evaluations. Principals sayan important outcome has been more effective teacher evaluation. The Colorado 2 + 2 Project Report 1987 summarizes activities in districts under grants provided by the state to develop innovative programs. The Evaluator Training Program sponsors workshops on effective evaluation techniques and provides technical assistance to districts for improving evaluation systems. Recommendations are that evaluator training needs to continue and that technical assistance should be available. The Arizona Career Ladder Research and Evaluation Project, established to compile information on that state\'s career ladder program, notes in a 1987 report that pilot districts with no evaluation procedures in place experienced more difficulty than those where procedures existed. The report emphasizes, however, that improvement from different starting points is a goal of the pilot projects. The report also notes the districts\' continuing need for research and evaluation. The 15 pilot projects have established a network for sharing information and support for development of district programs. Student achievement continues to be used as an evaluative consideration in several state and district programs. South Carolina and Florida fund school incentive programs to reward schools primarily for student achievement. Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina have teacher incentive programs that mandate the use of student achievement in assessment of teachers. Legislation enacted in 1987 in Texas called for the State Department of Education to study the use of student achievement in appraising teachers. A report is due to the 1989 legislature. In 1987, the Georgia legislature made a revision in the 1985 law establishing a commission to develop a career ladder program. The change specifies that achievement of students will be one criterion for moving up the ladder (the original law stated that student achievement may be included). The Alabama State Board of Education has directed the state superintendent to appoint a task force to examine methods and propose recommendations for a school incentive program that includes student achievement in the criteria.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina School Incentive Program, established by 1984 legislation, provides incentive awards to schools based on student achievement gains, student attendance, and teacher attendance. Schools are grouped into five categories, based on background of students. Gains in test scores are analyzed against predicted gains by matching students\' individual scores from one year to the next and aggregating them at the school level. The Teacher Incentive Program in South Carolina is highly dependent on teachers documenâˆ‘ ting student achievement progress that exceeds expected growth. To aid districts and teachers, the State Department of Education and the University of South Carolina jointly prepared a technical assistance manual. The premise of the manual is, \"Given the teaching situation, what are some sensible approaches to assessing student achievement?\" As mandated in the Utah career ladder legislation, student achievement is required as one piece of evidence used in evaluating teachers. The plans now show a greater reliance on measurâˆ‘ ing student achievement through classroom level techniques, such as teacher-designed tests rather than through the use of standardized tests, according to the state\'s analysis of the 1986-87 plans. Two targets of the Arizona career ladder pilot projects are better teacher performance and improvement in student academic achievement. The recent report on the project notes that \"all career ladder district plans have student achievement goals as a top priority.\" The evaluation project is studying the relationship between performance of career ladder teachers and academic achievement of students. Districts are using student achievement in a variety of ways as a part of teacher evaluation. A special project in conjunction with the 1986-87 Kentucky Career Ladder Pilot Program to determine effective ways to use student achievement in assessing teacher performance found that parents, teachers, and administrators believe student achievement should include more than standardized test scores. Teachers identified student achievement outcomes that are common to all types of students and disciplines and those that are specific to particular subject areas.\r\n\r\nOutcomes and Program Evaluations \" . .. can career ladder plans create opportunities for a fundamental restructuring of the teaching profession . .. ?\" Career Ladder Clearinghouse, July 1985 While we know that change in the schools will occur slowly-and indications are that it may be slower than most persons antiCipated-there must be extraordinary efforts before we will see differences in teaching and learning. Career ladders, mentor teacher programs, and bonuses based on performance have as goals recruiting and retaining teachers, improving teaching through evaluation and staff development, or improving the teaching and learning workplace. Improvements in the teacher workplace must involve changes for over two million teachers-changes such as rewarding excellence, conversion from a \"top down\" system to one with teachers making more decisions about teaching, and removing burdens of paperwork and non-instructional duties so that teachers can spend more time teaching and counseling students. Outside evaluations of several incentive programs have been completed or are underway. These studies are beginning to provide information on whether specific goals are being met and whether real change is taking place in schools. The most comprehensive study to date by an outside agency is the Far West Laboratory examination of the Utah Career Ladder System, which includes four parts: extended day, job enlargement (additional duties), performance bonus, and career ladder levels. The study included interviews with superintendents and board of education preSidents. Principals, teachers, and parents were surveyed. In addition, site visits were conducted at 12 of the state\'s 40 districts. Preliminary evidence from the study suggests: âˆ‘ The career ladder program is moving schools toward a new reward system. âˆ‘ Major reform of management processes in the schools is being seen; shared leadership is developing; how teachers view their work is changing.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nâˆ‘ A common language is being used to discuss curriculum reform, teaching effectiveness, and teacher evaluation. âˆ‘ In districts where the programs are most effective there is now a strong relationship between district goals and those of teachers and principals. âˆ‘ Teachers have more responsibilities for developing curriculum, evaluating peers, and in decisions about school and district goals; principals view their work differently as their instructional leadership increases. âˆ‘ The system is being implemented differently in districts. The relationship between implementation of the program and impact is strong. In Colorado, 20 pilot projects to develop innovative programs to advance teaching have been supported. Pilot projects showed mixed results, according to a State Department of Education report. Mentor teacher, teacher leadership, and school-based performance incentives were considered successful. Three years of planning time and additional funds are seen as necessary to design career ladders. The report noted that differentiated staffing programs will take four years to demonstrate results. Districts that originally intended to develop \"merit pay\" programs shifted to job ladders or incentive programs for all teachers. Based on the project, it was recommended that the General Assembly and the State Board of Education have primary responsibility for career development/recognition systems by providing funding and coordinating the development of guidelines for district-developed programs. Teacher attitudes vary by programs within a state and from state to state, according to surveys of teachers. In Missouri, a May 1987 survey of 600 teachers (300 career ladder, 300 noncareer ladder) found no differences in morale of teachers, but job satisfaction was significantly higher among the career ladder teachers. The Utah study noted strong agreement among prinCipals and teachers that morale and leadership opportunities for teachers and the overall instructional program have improved. The 1985 Arizona legislation establishing a Career Ladder Pilot Test Program included research and evaluation to determine if student achievement is increased through recognizing and developing high levels of teacher performance. Preliminary studies have compiled teachers\' reactions to the programs. The 1987 results, based on the second year of the pilot (the first full year of implementation), noted that 50 percent of the teachers inthe pilot districts have applied for or been placed on the ladder. As in other states, teacher support for the career ladder concepts differed by district. The study showed a significant positive relationship between climate in districts and support for the career ladder program. Attitudes between participating and nonparticipating teachers showed career ladder teachers showed more support for career ladder \"concepts\" than did non-career ladder teachers; less experienced teachers were more positive; females supported concepts to a much greater degree than males. There was agreement about the importance of extrinsic rewards of money, but intrinsic rewards are seen as poorly defined or utilized in the programs. (The report notes that given the problems with adequate funding, this should be an area for further study.) While 72 percent of participating teachers believed the program will improve instruction, only 52 percent of non-participating teachers did. On the other hand, about the same percentage of both groups of teachers (around 43 percent) said it would improve teacher cooperation; 29 percent felt it would improve teacher morale. Teachers were asked to provide open-ended responses to questions about program strengths and weaknesses. Just over one-third (34 percent) of the teachers said higher pay rather than the traditional salary schedule and incentives to keep up the good work were the greatest strengths. The need for a uniform method of evaluation was reported by 28 percent of teachers as an area needing improvement. The South Carolina study documented teachers\' attitudes about the Teacher Incentive Program in the state. (Three models are being piloted in South Carolina-bonus model, career ladder, and school incentivelindividual models.) About 17 percent of the eligible teachers participate in the program; budget estimates were based on 20 percent. The time required and opposition to the notion of competing were reported as major factors for those not participating. Most teachers said that each school should not necessarily have the same percentage of teachers awarded bonus pay. A majority of the teachers did not think the program had encouraged teachers to improve their teaching skills or that it had helped keep superior teachers in the classroom. Forty-four\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\npercent of the teachers agreed that an unbaised process could be implemented to identify and reward superior teachers. The authors of the study conclude, \"It would be naive to expect teachers-even those voluntarily participating-to strongly support an externally-mandated program that breaks a long-standing tradition of paying teachers on a non-competitive, nonproductivity-oriented basis.\" Providing new roles for teachers on a short-term basis may create problems. One local district evaluator is employed for every 96 employees to be evaluated in each pilot district in the North Carolina Career Development Program. Difficulties in returning to the classroom have been reported, with teachers noting that returning to a more regular classroom setting is difficult. A North Carolina project that is working to restructure schools by providing new roles for teachers is \"marrying\" the lead teacher idea to the state\'s Career Development Program. The program, authorized by the 1987 General Assembly, provides additional salary to Career Status II and III teachers who take on additional duties.\r\nSustained Commitment\r\n\r\nEvaluation procedures are changing, a common vocabulary for discussing instruction is emerging, and more attention to instruction by those outside the classroom is evident as incentive programs for teachers, administrators,and schools are put into place. A key question is whether or not commitment by political and educational leadership-both at the state and local levels-will be sustained long enough to give the programs a fair test. Reports from some states that because of the programs schools may be changing are encouraging. Will it be enough? Programs are not yet \"finished products.\" Teachers and administrators in local districts will need to work closely with state educational and political leaders to urge\' the necessary changes. State and district leaders will need to be responsive but diligent in overseeing that programs are being implemented as originally intended. At the same time, leaders will have to be ready to make changes and \"fine tune\" to find methods that work best. Career ladder and incentive programs provide ways to restructure schools, reward superior teaching, and focus on student learning; however, additional efforts and sustained commitment will be necessary before real change is seen.\r\n\r\nSelected Resources\r\nColorado Department of Education. \"2 + 2 Project Report 1987.\" August 1987.

The original 1985 legislation established the program in two phases-Phase I to develop evaluation methods and Phase II to implement the program, with salary increases for teachers who are placed on the Career Professionalll or Master levels. During 1987-88, all teachers will be evaluated; information will be used for placing teachers on the upper levels of the ladder if funding is provided by the 1988 legislature. A commission appointed to develop the procedures was involved in controversy during 1985-86 and was slow to come to agreement, which delayed implementation of the evaluation procedures by one year. The evaluation system was field-tested in the spring of 1986. Over 3,000 school and central office administrators were trained to conduct classroom observations and pre- and post-conferences with teachers in the fall of the 1986-87 school year. To be certified as an evaluator, administrators must pass a written test and be proficient in making classroom observations. According to state officials, the emphasis on evaluation procedures has provided administrators and teachers with a common language about instruction and a focus on how to improve conditions for learning. Because of fiscal problems in the state, full funding for the program in 1988-89 is not expected. However, the evaluation plan is expected to continue, and discussions about a modified program are underway.\r\n\r\nAlaska\r\nDue to declining oil revenues, Alaska has no career ladder or teacher incentive programs. Local districts have the authority to establish such programs, but given the economic outlook, it is unlikely that any are currently being initiated.\r\n\r\nArizona\r\nLegislation passed in 1984, 1985, and 1986 established and amended a five-year career ladder pilot program and authorized a Joint Legislative Committee (conSisting of ten legislators, one educator, one member of the State Board of Education, and one additional member) to be involved with the approval and monitoring of pilot districts. As legislated, the pilot program involves the approval and funding of locally deSigned programs developed in consultation with teachers. Criteria for the projects include procedures that stress a multifaceted approach to the assessment of teacher performance, a compensation system based on a completely restructured salary schedule, evidence of teacher support, and a way to show how student achievement would be improved. The 1986 law provided for eventual statewide career ladder implementation subject to legislative approval and voter approval of a constitutional amendment increasing the spending limit for school districts. By January 1, 1988, the Joint Legislative Committee must make preliminary recommendations regarding possible statewide program implementation beginning in 1989-90. One estimate projected implementation would cost approximately $60 million. Currently, 15 districts within the state are in some phase of implementing career ladder programs-seven districts began programs in 1985-86; three in 1986-87; and five in 1987-88. State funding for 1987-88 has been provided at a level of $8.8 million, a $4.8 million increase over 1986-87.\r\n\r\nArkansas\r\nBecause for the second year, the Teacher Career Development Commission was not funded, no grants were made to school districts for locally-developed pilot projects. Funding shortfalls in the state mean that the future of the program is uncertain. The Commission, appointed by the governor, was established in 1985 according to legislation that called for pilot projects. Five districts developed plans at the local level.\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nCalifornia\r\n\r\nThe California Mentor Teacher Program, created in 1983, is intended to encourage retention of exemplary teachers and upgrade the skills of experienced as well as new teachers. This is to be accomplished by selecting \"mentor teachers\" who are designated to spend part of their time working with new and experienced teachers. Individual school districts and county offices voluntarily participate in the mentor program. The legislation establishing this program allows districts broad latitude in designing, implementing, and evaluating their individual mentor programs. The intent is that each district develop a program tailored to the particular educational needs of its staff. State law authorizes districts to designate up to 5 percent of their certified teachers as mentors; state funds, however, have not been sufficient to fully support the statutory limit. Each mentor receives a $4,000 stipend and the local district receives an additional $2,000 per mentor for support costs, such as training and release time. Funding and participation have increased significantly since the program was initiated. In 1984-85, the first full year of implementation, a $30.8 million appropriation supported 4,362 designated mentors in 742 districts. This financed 2.84 percent of the teachers in the state. In 1987-88, funds amounting to $49.75 million are available to support 8,273 teachers, approximately 4 percent of the state\'s teachers. There are no legislative requirements as to how mentors shall be evaluated. Districts are encouraged to work closely with mentor selection committees to ensure that evaluation processes are developed in collaboration with sound measurement practices and that they mirror the real work mentors have been doing.\r\nColorado\r\n\r\nAs a part of the Educational Quality Act of 1985, a two-year research and development project was funded to improve educational quality. Under this program, 20 pilot projects were supported to research and test the value of innovative programs to advance teaching. The projects addressed such issues as career ladders, mentor teacher programs, career enrichment, and performance incentives. The Department of Education\'s final report on the program in August 1987 concluded that a statewide approach to the issue of incentives was not feasible for Colorado. It recommended that the state should coordinate the development of guidelines for teacher advancement and recognition which would allow for local district variations, and that local districts should estfilblish opportunities for the advancement, recognition, and compensation of teachers within those state guidelines.\r\nConnecticut\r\n\r\nIn January 1987, legislation was signed into law by the governor that addressed increases in minimum salaries for teachers (to $20,000), professional development, teacher evaluation, and teacher career incentives programs. Under this law, the Connecticut Department of Education is providing grants to assist local and regional boards of education and regional educational service centers in developing new or revising existing teacher evaluation programs. Grants are also pro, \"vided to plan teacher career incentive programs. The development of career incentive programs may include compensation related to factors other than seniority and academic degree; the naming of mentor and cooperating teachers; curriculum development; peer assessment; peer counseling; master teachers; a career advancement ladder; and the consideration of performance, experience, job-related education, and advanced academic training. The teacher evaluation and the career incentives programs each received $1 million in funding for grants to be made either in 1987-88 or 1988-89 (districts may apply for funds in one year or the other but not in both). It is anticipated that funds will be available in 1988-89 for implementation and continued development of teacher career incentive and teacher evaluation programs.\r\nDelaware\r\n\r\nEarly efforts in Delaware focused on career ladder and other teacher incentive programs. Funds were appropriated in 1985 for the development and implementation of a career ladder program. When agreement on a program could not be reached, the funds were used to develop teacher training models and to implement a statewide evaluation instrument.\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nI,\r\n\r\nIi\r\n\r\nDelaware is now emphasizing professional development for teachers and principals. All teachers are being trained in the elements of effective teaching; principals are being trained in evaluation fundamentals. Additionally, four pilot districts are involved in a career enhancement program. The Christina School District pilot project is based on different skills and levels of performance for each staff position. The program includes additional working time, extended responsibilities, performance measured through observations and the use of student outcomes. The first year of the program (1987-88) includes: a mentor program in which teachers will work with new teachers and provide ongoing assistance to peers, grants for innovative instructional projects, and funds for school improvement projects. Incentives for attendance and student outcomes are to be phased in for the 1988-89 school year.\r\n\r\nFlorida Legislation in 1986 established the Raymond B. Stewart Career Achievement Program. The 1986 program was developed after the 1983 Master Teacher program was repealed. In the new program districts are more involved in determining who should move up on the ladder. Classroom observations would be conducted by a supervisor and a peer from the district. The program would be negotiated at the local district and approved by the State Department of Education. The career advancement system has three levels: Level I is for beginning teachers who meet district requirements for employment; Level II requirements include four years of teaching experience, possession of a professional service or tenured contract, and the attainment of specific percentile ranking on subject area tests and performance evaluations; Level III requirements include six years as a Level II teacher, a master\'s degree in the subject taught, possession of a professional service or tenured contract, and the attainment of specific percentile ranking on subject area tests and performance eval uations. In March 1987, district proposals were submitted from 39 of 67 Florida school districts for program implementation during the 1987-88 school year. Because the required funding was not appropriated by the 1987 legislature, implementation of the program has been temporarily deferred. The statute specifies that if $90 million is not appropriated by July 1988, the program will be repealed. Georgia Mandated by 1985 legislation, the State Board of Education appointed the Career Ladder Task Force, which provided the State Board of Education with detailed recommendations in June 1986. These recommendations were carefully studied by staff, and plans for implementation were developed. The draft plan was presented to the State Board of Education in February 1987. Six thousand copies of the draft were distributed to educators and interested citizens throughout Georgia for review and comment. As respondents began raising concerns, questionnaires were . developed to elicit further feedback. The plan includes five career levels: Level I teachers are those entering the profession or ones with less than three years of experience. Level II is for teachers who have completed all requirementsfor regular teaching status, but who do not wish to move up on the ladder, to receive supplementary compensation. Teachers will develop three-year professional plans for moving to the upper levels. A district review team will make recommendations for advancement on the ladder,.based on evidence presented by the applicant. Pilot testing of the Georgia Personnel Evaluation System was carried out in nine school systems during the 1986-87 school year. Further refinements and pilot testing will take place in 1987-88. Funding for development and implementa) tion is $1.3 million. The Department of Education is presently revising the February draft incorporating the feedback and concerns of Georgia educators and the experiences gained from other states. The revisions are scheduled to be presented to the State Board of Education in December 1987. Details about local system plans and evaluation will be worked out after a final draft of a plan has been approved by the Board of Education. The General Assembly made a revision in the law during the 1987 session. The original legislation called for development of a plan for rewarding average-or-above olassroom performance, which may include the achievement of students beyond the level expected. 1987 legislation specifically includes the use of achievement of students beyond the typical level as one\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\ncriterion for moving up the ladder. The new plan is to be reviewed by the General Assembly prior to funding. The Bibb County Schools support a Pilot Quality School Performance Plan that offers bonuses to teams of elementary teachers to improve test scores in grades two through six. The program is financed through funds raised in the business community. Twenty-one elementary schools volunteered for the program and three were selected for the 3-year project. A goals committee composed of educators and business persons established the scores expected to be achieved on nationally-normed tests. Training wa~ provided to the staff of each participating school. All persons in the school holding a certificate are eligible for the cash bonus (a maximum of $2,000), which is determined by the improvement in test scores. Over $75,000 had been awarded to staff by the end of 1986-87 (the second year of the project). .\r\n\r\nHawaii A number of programs implemented in Hawaii have offered incentives for teachers to relocate to remote areas of the state or to supervise pre-service instruction. An alternative certification program has also been implemented to address teacher shortages in mathematics and science. This program involves provisions for certifying persons with undergraduate degrees in mathematics and science as well as current teachers desiring to seek certification in the shortage areas. The Reaching for Excellence in Instruction Schools Incentives Program (REISIP) was developed to improve the quality of instruction provided by teachers and to increase student performance by recognizing and rewarding school administrators and teachers. The Department of Education requested that the 1987 legislature appropriate $2 million to implement the program during the 1987-89 biennium; however, funds were not provided. Idaho Legislation enacted in 1984 permitted school districts to participate in the Teacher Excellence Program; $100,000 was appropriated for administration and assistance to local districts in developing career compensation plans in fiscal 1985, with the expectation that these plans would be implemented during the following year. While the 1985 legislature did not appropriate the funding for local career compensation plans due to economic considerations, $90,000 was provided to the State Department of Ed~cation to continue a local district assistance program, with a verbal commitment to address the career ladder issue in upcoming legislative sessions. The 1986 and 1987 legislatures did not appropriate funding for the local career compensation plans. Districts are submitting plans for approval in antiCipation of funding by the 1988 legislature, although there appears to be little hope that funding will be provided. Illinois The Education Reform Act of 1986 authorized the establishment of a Center for Excellence in Teaching within the State Board of Education to conduct a study of teacher career compensation programs based on merit. The State Board of Education was authorized to fund five to seven pilot programs in local districts; $1 million was allocated for the implementation phase during 1986-87. The pilot programs were designed to identify, from an array of various types, compensation programs that the General Assembly might then extend on a statewide basis. Proposals were . solicited from all Illinois school districts; 30 proposals were received, all of which were developed by the school districts in conjunction with their teachers and a participating university. In March 1986, seven districts, representing a diverse collection of sizes and types and with programs offering a variety of approaches to the compensation issue, were awarded grants to continue developing plans for implementation of a full year of career compensation during the 1986-87 school year. Indiana In 1985, the Indiana General Assembly passed a law which required the State Superintendent of Education to determine the feasibility of a career ladder plan and to develop methods to honor, recognize, and provide professional growth for teachers. A teacher quality team was created by the state superintendent in response to this law. The team, with the assistance of three advisory\r\n13\r\n\r\ncommittees that included more than 100 individuals, developed a request for proposals for pilot projects involving career ladders and career development. The general assembly appropriated $6 million for an initial two-year period. By January 1987, 76 pilot projects were addressing the issues of honor, recognition, and professional development of teachers, and seven districts and one educational organization were conducting career ladder studies. In August 1987, the most popular results of these pilots were incorporated into a preliminary draft of a plan that would allow state dollars to fund activities above a teacher\'s core salary. The draft plan includes career development and career ladder plans. The career development plan builds on a teacher\'s core salary. The five areas beyond the core salary include professional attainment (teachers are trained in a specific professional development activity then, in turn, teach other teachers); mentoring (an experienced teacher guides a first-year teacher or another experienced teacher); mini-grants (to fund such projects as the development of in-school projects, curriculum materials, or summer projects); participatory management (teachers participate in the decision-making process); and outcome-based education (students progress from one instructional unit to another as significant progress is achieved). Four of the original eight career ladder study sites have been selected to continue developing their plans during 1987-88. The diverse plans will offer four distinct types of career ladder programs for the state. The structure of these plans will be available for review by the districts early in the 1988-89 school year. Participation in the proposed program is voluntary on two levels. First, district participation in any or all of the plan\'s elements is optional. Second, teachers within each district can opt to participate in any part of the district\'s adopted program. Funding has been provided for the 1987-89 biennium at a level of $4 million, the majority of which will be utilized to support regional networks designed to train teachers and develop instruments associated with the career development plan.\r\nIowa\r\n\r\nLegislation enacted in 1987 established the Educational Excellence Program consisting of three major phases addressing the following areas: Phase I - the recruitment of quality teachers Phase II - the retention of quality teachers Phase 111- improving the quality and effectiveness of teachers Phase I establishes a minimum teacher salary of $18,000 for all teachers. Phase II provides district boards of directors with funds to improve salaries above the minimum. Phase III promotes excellence through the development of performance-based pay plans and supplemental pay plans requiring additional work assignments. Each district wishing to participate in Phase III must appOint a committee composed of administrators, teachers, parents, and other interested individuals to develop a proposal relating to performance-based pay, supplemental pay, or a combination of the two. The proposal is to be considered by the district board of directors in developing a plan for submission to the Iowa Department of Education. District entitlements for approved plans will be based on an enrollment formula. The legislature appropriated $92.5 million for the 1987-88 school year. Of this amount, approximately $43 million will be available for the implementation of Phase III plans. The Des Moines Independent Community School District has appointed a planning committee that has developed a proposal for participation in phase III, which encompasses a combination performance-supplemental pay plan utilizing four career levels-probationary and career levels I, II, and III. Criteria for entry into the career levels will be based on experience, education, evaluation, service, and professional growth/staff development. The proposal provides for a threeyear phase-in of the program prior to full implementation. Incentives associated with the career levels will include salary stipends for performance, pay for additional work, incentive payments for staff development, grants for professional growth, paid attendance at conferences, and sabbaticals.\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nKansas The Commissioner\'s Task Force on Teacher Incentive Structures, created in 1985, recommended in its report that incentive systems should be developed at the local level rather than on a statewide basis. While local boards have the option to initiate such programs, few have done so. Kansas has been plagued in recent years by a sluggish economy that is anticipated to recover somewhat in the upcoming year. Despite this estimate, there appears to be little prospect for the consideration of any teacher incentive proposals during the 1988 legislative session. Kentucky The one-year, $2.5 million pilot career ladder project has been completed and recommendations will be made to the 1988 legislature. The pilot program, in accord with 1984 legislation, was originally designed for two years, but was reduced to one year because of fiscal problems. Fortyseven schools and over 300 teachers participated. Teachers, who participated voluntarily, received a $1,000 stipend. The project focused on field-testing evaluation procedures. Based on the 1986-87 pilot program, the Career Ladder Commission recommends that the Department of Education continue the research and development of teacher evaluation. In addition, training and assistance for districts to implement the evaluation procedures is suggested. The Commission also recommends that the Kentucky General Assembly pass legislation to establish demonstration sites in three school districts to continue the refinement of evaluation procedures and use differential salary schedules. Louisiana Projects to provide incentives for teachers have been slowed or stymied because of the fiscal crisis in Louisiana. After a 1984 Career Ladder Commission failed to reach agreement, 1985 legislation established the Teacher Incentive Pay Models Program to provide grants to districts for pilot incentive programs. However, no funding is available. Several other programs for teachers have also been established by the legislature, but not funded. Included is a teacher internship program that would require beginning teachers to be evaluated and supported during the first year of employment by a principal, a master teacher, and faculty from a teacher education program. A MentorTeacher Program to utilize mentor teachers in assisting new teachers was included in 1986 legislation. Mentor teachers would work an additional 10 hours per week for additional compensation. No funding is available. Teacher of the Year awards are given and the state will provide $1.8 million during 1987-88 in tuition exemption for teachers so that they can pursue coursework in their respective subject areas. Maine A two-year certification pilot study was conducted by 20 school districts from April 1984 through December 1986 as a result of legislation adopted in 1984. This law established three levels of certification-a two-year provisional certificate for beginning teachers, a renewable fiveyear professional certificate, and a master teacher certificate. Under the law, while serving the two-year provisional term, beginning teachers are supervised and evaluated by support systems consisting primarily of teachers; criteria include professional classroom skills and subject matter knowledge. After successfully completing the provisional term, the teachers will be granted the professional certificate. Professional teachers are eligible to apply for a master teacher certificate. Legislation to amend the elements of the 1984 law was passed during the 1987 session. The legislation included a plan to eliminate the master teacher level of certification while continuing the provisional and professional levels. The governor subsequently vetoed the elimination of the master teacher certificate, effectively continuing the three-level certification program adopted in 1984 This certification program will take effect July 1,1988. The State Board of Education has recently adopted procedures for the statewide implementation of the certification program, standards for the support systems, and a process for appeals pertaining to applications for the issuance and renewal of certificates. The support systems as defined in the adopted procedures are locally-developed, state-approved mechanisms for assisting teachers in meeting certification requirements. Each district\'s support system is to be comprised of a governance committee that includes a majority of classroom teachers. A plan for\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nthe support system based upon stated criteria must be developed by a planning committee in each district and submitted to the State Department of Education for approval.\r\nMaryland\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\nL\r\n\r\nA 1986 resolution of the House of Delegates established a governor-appointed Commission on Teacher Salaries and Incentives to examine financial and non-financial awards in teaching. Specific issues to be addressed were salary increases and incentives, such as expansion of scholarship programs in teacher education, mentor teacher/new teacher induction programs, and summer employment of teachers to conduct research in their content areas. The Commission also examined funding to ensure a well-trained and motivated teaching staff. A final report was presented to the governor in October 1987. Incentive programs for teachers and administrators are continuing to develop at the local level. Legislation in 1984 enabled districts to receive state education aid to develop programs for improving teacher performance. The Teacher Plus program in the Frederick County Schools is in its third year of implementation. The program focuses on teacher assignments that recognize the profeSSional competence of a teacher. An additional 10 days of pay provide opportunities for profeSSional development. The present indication is that the program is highly successful. Carroll County schools provide differential pay for duties such as team leader or department chair. Rankings for administrative positions are also given. Harford County schools have implemented a program to recognize elementary school teachers for significant and unique types of curriculum activities and projects. The program provides both monetary awards to teachers and a vehicle for sharing the exemplary projects with elementary schools throughout the country.\r\nMassachusetts\r\n\r\nThe Public School Improvement Act of 1985 established a far-reaching program of educational reform that included several types of teacher incentive programs. The act called for a minimum teacher\'s salary of $18,000, and state funding to pay for some of the educational expenses of those who agree to teach within the state after their graduation. The legislation also established the \"Horace Mann Teacher\" deSignation and the Lucretia Crocker Exemplary Education Program. Under the former, the Board of Education developed guidelines for establishing programs for expanded duties for teachers, including responsibilities for training teachers, developing curricula, providing special assistance to potential drop-outs, and serving as in-service instructors or consultants. Subject to collective bargaining, school committees designate the Horace Mann teachers on the basis of criteria supplied from the State Board of Education. Each school district may apply for a grant equivalent to $120 per teacher; maximum extra compensation for each Horace Mann teacher is $2,500. There is a possibility that legislation will be introduced during the 1988 session to increase these amounts. The Lucretia Crocker program was created to award teacher fellowships to develop, replicate, and disseminate exemplary educational programs that have been successful in advancing academic and creative achievement and creating a better school climate. Exemplary programs nominated in January 1986 were implemented in the 1986-87 fiscal year. Currently, 20 one-year fellowships are being supported by the state. The Joint Task Force on Teacher Preparation, convened in May 1987 by the Board of Regents of Higher Education and the Board of Education, proposed the creation of a mentor teacher program as a part of its recommendations. The role of the mentor teachers was seen as a critical element in the preparation of new teachers. The task force recommended that teacher preparation programs be revamped to require extensive classroom experience supervised by the mentor teachers. While the task force did not detail the mechanics of such a program, it did recommend that mentor teachers complete a training program, receive salary supplements and release time to perform their supervisory responsibilities, and hold a joint appointment to the public school and to the college from which the supervised students are completing their degrees.\r\nMichigan\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no state-level effort toward establishing performance-based programs for teachers and administrators. The major focus of the Michigan State Board of Education has been to tighten certification requirements for teachers effective September 1, 1988. 16\r\n\r\nThere is a possibility that tuition assistance for prospective teachers may be addressed during the upcoming legislative session. The Michigan State Board of Education appointed a special task force commission that reported in October 1986 on the supply and demand of teachers. The commission recommended that such assistance be made available. One legislator has expressed an interest in offering legislation to provide tuition assistance to future teachers.\r\nMinnesota\r\n\r\nThere is no statewide program of teacher incentives. Local boards, however, have been given discretionary power to adopt their own incentive programs using local district funds. The State Board of Teaching has furnished some guidance for developing programs. There are no plans to introduce a general incentive system in the upcoming legislative session.\r\nMississippi\r\n\r\nAbout 98 percent of the teachers in Mississippi who have been evaluated using the Mississippi Teacher Appraisal System have passed, and are to receive an additional $1,000 for 1987-88. The money is the third part of the three-year pay raise; the last year is based on merit, according to a 1985 legislative mandate. Teachers were assessed using the Mississippi Teacher Appraisal instrument. Administrators were trained to make classroom observations using the statewide procedures. Administrators and instructional support personnel will also be evaluated. The Board of Trustees for the Jackson Public School District has adopted a Professional Growth Plan for certified faculty members of the district. The plan, which is set to be implemented over the next five years, will establish four categories for teachers: (1) provisional teacher, (2) certified teacher, (3) senior teacher, (4) master teacher. With each step in this four-step plan, the faculty member is given more responsibility, contract time, and compensation. The entire process will be administered by a Professional Growth Plan Board, composed of four master teachers elected by the master teachers of the district, who will serve two-year terms on a full-time basis. Under this plan, a master teacher could eventually make $42,000 per year.\r\nMissouri\r\n\r\nIn April 1986, the State Board of Education approved a career ladder model and guidelines for the development of individual district plans. The model was developed by an advisory committee appointed by the State Board as a result of a 1985 education reform act. The model consists of three stages, each of which contains a set of predetermined criteria. Both district and teacher partiCipation is voluntary; however, should a district decide to participate, it must guarantee local funds to supplement an allocation made by the state in reaching the state-specified salary supplement levels: $1,500-Stage I; $3,000-Stage II; $5,000-Stage III. District plans must conform to the state model and guidelines. In 1986-87, 2,369 teachers; librarians, and counselors in 63 school districts qualified to reach Stage I. The state provided $2.6 million to support the first year of implementation. For 1987-88, the state appropriated $8 million to continue the career ladder program. It is estimated that 45 districts will implement Stage II. Estimates indicate total participation in the second year of the program to be 5,600 teachers (12 percent of all teachers in the state) in 128 districts (24 percent of the districts).\r\nMontana\r\n\r\nDuring 1985-86, an experimental administrative program was implemented to identify teachers with the potential of becoming principals and to assist these teachers in completing certification requirements. The selected teachers may act in the capacity of principal under supervision for a period of up to three years while working toward certification. A similar program was initiated in 1987-88 for those certified teachers seeking their special education endorsement. While completing the requirements, a person may teach in special education under supervision for up to one year.\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nAlthough the governor raised the issue of incentive pay for teachers three years ago, the legislature has not considered the issue. The State Board of Public Education and the Montana Education Association have, however, initiated a certification advisory group to review issues pertaining to the teaching profession.\r\nNebraska\r\n\r\nProvisions for a career ladder were enacted by the legislature in 1984 as a part of the governor\'s omnibus education improvement bill. The legislature postponed the implementation date twice. In 1987 legislation, the implementation date was removed from law and a provision was added that made initiation of the program dependent upon funding. Funding still has not been provided to the Department of Education for development and implementation of the program.\r\nNevada\r\n\r\nThe Committee on School Improvement Through Incentives, in an April 1985 report directed to legislators and state and local education agency personnel, recommended that local districts be encouraged to develop various kinds of incentive programs with state funding. However, no legislation has been enacted, no funding has been provided, and there has been no real movement toward any sort of incentive system in any of the local districts.\r\nNew Hampshire\r\n\r\nThe New Hampshire educational system is decentralized and is primarily financed through local funds. The State Board of Education has encouraged local districts to adopt compensation and incentive plans for teachers; however, any action taken is strictly a matter of local option. Several districts are experimenting with some form of incentive program. The State Board of Education is monitoring such efforts with the intent of passing along useful information to other districts contemplating the development of similar programs.\r\nNew Jersey\r\n\r\nContinuing state initiatives to improve the teaching profession include a guaranteed minimum salary of $18,500 for all public school teachers; the Governor\'s Teaching Scholars Program to attract talented high school students to teaching; the Governor\'s Teacher Grant Program, which awards up to $15,000 each for creative teachers to develop effective strategies and disseminate them to others as models; the Academy for the Advancement of Teaching and Management, designed to train teams of teachers and principals in proven techniques of instruction and instructional supervision; and the Commissioner\'s Symposium for Outstanding Teachers in which 100 of the state\'s outstanding teachers are chosen to receive awards and to attend a three-day summer workshop for exchanging ideas with other state educators. Two new programs were introduced in 1987-88. The Minority Teacher Program is designed to attract promising minority high school students to the teaching profession. College loans of up to $7,500 per year are available and will be forgiven in return for teaching service in New Jersey schools. The Public Service Information Campaign on Teaching provides accurate information on teaching as a career and describes the programs initiated by the state to enhance the teaching profession. Teacher certification standards have been raised in several ways, including the implementation of the Provisional Teacher Program where qualified candidates who have not completed college teacher preparation programs can earn certification; emphasis on subject matter competency as well as strengthening of traditional college teacher preparation programs; the requirement that teaching candidates hold bachelor\'s degrees in liberal arts, science, or technology; and the requirement that all new teacher candidates pass teacher competency tests before they can be certified.\r\nNew Mexico\r\n\r\nIn 1985, the legislature requested continued study of performance-based pay systems, but severe drops in state revenues due to the oil crisis continue to undermine efforts to initiate incentive programs. The newly elected governor is interested in establishing pilot performance-based\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n,[\r\n\r\nIi !.\r\n\r\nk\r\ni\r\nI\r\nI;âˆ‘\r\n\r\npay programs in school districts; however, it is difficult to predict whether the legislature will be receptive to such programs in light of the revenue outlook. New York Increased financial support has been provided for 1987-88 to expand a number of programs designed to strengthen the teaching profession. The legislature appropriated $131 million to increase teacher salaries, as compared to $95 million last year. The Mentor Teacher-Internship Program was increased from $4 million to $8 million in its second year of implementation for districts to initiate programs that provide first-year teachers with guidance, support, and leadership from their more experienced colleagues. Funding for teacher education centers increased by $5 million to a total of $15 million. The goal of these centers is to assist teachers and other school personnel in increasing their capacity to meet the educational needs of their students. Funding remained stable in the Empire State Challenger Scholarship and Fellowship Programs ($4 million) for students preparing to teach in shortage areas and in the Teacher Summer Business Employment Program ($6.4 million), which provides incentives to private employers for hiring teachers during the summer. The Teacher Opportunity Corps was initiated with a $1 million appropriation in an effort to attract potential teachers into working with at-risk students. The funds, allocated to teacher education programs, will be used to provide enriched instruction in the special needs of the at-risk student. The Rochester Board of Education and the Rochester Teachers Association have negotiated an agreement that involves a career program for teachers that contains several levels. Beginning teachers will start as interns for the first year while working under the supervision of experienced teachers. They will then have the opportunity to progress to a resident status (years 1 through 4) and then to a fully-licensed professional. Beyond the professional level is one further category-lead teachers, who will be selected by a joint panel of experienced teachers and administrators and will spend at least 50 percent of their time teaching. The lead teachers will spend the balance of their time serving as mentors to new teachers, as intervention teachers working with experienced teachers who are having trouble in their duties, or in other leadership roles. In an agreement with the University of Rochester, upper-level teachers may become adjunct faculty. Movement along this path is not automatic-teachers whose difficulties are not sufficiently remedied through the assistance of a lead teacher will be removed or will be placed in a more suitable position within the system. The second element in the negotiated agreement involves raising teacher salaries. If the agreement is ratified, teacher salaries are scheduled to increase by more than 40 percent over a three-year period. The average teacher salary in Rochester would increase from last year\'s level of $32,651 to $45,774 in the third year of the plan. North Carolina The Career Development Program (a four-year pilot program) mandated by 1984 legislation is entering its third year with funding of $16 million -about $4 million more than in 1986-87. Involving 16 districts in the state, 96 percent of the eligible teachers are participating; nine districts have 99 or 100 percent participation. The first year of the pilot project, 1985-86, was spent in developing a new statewide evaluation procedure and an extensive in-service program to train school te~chers, evaluators, and administrators in effective teaching research. In the fall of 1986-87, all teachers receiving an \"at standard\" evaluation were placed at Career Status I and advanced an additional step on the salary schedule. At the end of the second year (1986-87), 42 percent of the staff in the pilot districts were awarded Career Status II. (These teachers have to perform \"above-standard\" on classroom evaluation and meet experience requirements.) Career Status II teachers earn 15 percent more than they would ordinarily earn. Approximately 80 percent of those who applied moved to Status II. This varied from 22 to 53 percent across the districts. The state has compiled data about the evaluation methods and will continue to do so during the pilot years. Studies are underway to increase the reliability and conSistency of the evaluations. Outside evaluators are also being used to check on reliability across the pilot districts. 19\r\n\r\n\'I\r\n\r\nThe 1987 legislature expanded the original legislation and provided $4 million for Career Status II and III teachers who take on additional responsibilities. This is in addition to the extra 15 percent that Career Status II teachers earn. Duties for Status II teachers include supervising student teachers, staff training, and curriculum development. Status III teachers will be eligible for department or grade chair assignments or lead teachers. State board and legislative committees are currently conducting studies of the state\'s pilot programs.\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota A state model for in-service education and staff development, designed to serve the local school districts as a basis for determining total needs of the veteran teaching staff, has been adopted. The design of assessment instruments to accompany the model is being discussed. No initiatives on career ladders or teacher incentive programs were forthcoming during the 1987 legislative session. Ohio . In December of 1984, the State Board of Education adopted a Master Plan for Excellence that called for the establishment of a career ladder and peer review program. In Toledo, the public schools and Federation of Teachers have established the Toledo Career Development Plan for the Professionalization of Teaching designed to give teachers more responsibility, opportunity for professional growth, and competitive salariEfs. The career ladder plan has five steps after initial qualification; teachers can reach the top level in 8 to 12 years. Reaching the top level will add $15,000 to a teacher\'s base salary. The initial qualification to begin working up the ladder is based upon five areas-letters of reference, a written essay, an interview before a three-member committee, a language test, and six classroom observations by three mentor teachers. Movement further up the ladder will require classroom observations and additional assignments. Teachers may opt to remain at the second level of the ladder, which requires periodic observation to hold that position. The top two levels require a master\'s degree or graduate hours in an academic area. The state provided $300,000 to the Toledo schools for the program. It is estimated that these funds will be barely sufficient to keep the program going for the initial two years of implementation. Oklahoma Statewide criteria for evaluating teachers and school administrators is in place in the state, according to 1985 legislation. Criteria were written as guidelines for district-developed evaluation procedures. Since 1986, tenured teachers have been evaluated yearly; evaluations of probationary teachers take place twice a year. The State Department of Education training required for all evaluators is ongoing. Although a career ladder was proposed in the 1985 legislature, no action was taken. Oregon The 1987 legislature passed a bill that provides for a professional development and school improvement program. $2.4 million has been appropriated for the 1987-89 biennium to support local committee-developed pilot projects at individual schools. Funds will be allocated by providing $1,000 per teacher at each pilot site. Within the same legislation, the Beginning Teacher Support Program has been established to ensure that the induction of beginning teachers is conducive to professional growth and development. As outlined in the law, each district that qualifies to participate in the program will receive $3,000 to support each beginning teacher. Currently, 55 districts and 185 beginning teachers are participating in the program. It is estimated that 760 beginning teachers will participate during 1988-89. Biennial funding has been provided at a level of $3 million. Additionally, the Oregon Teacher Corps Program has been established to encourage students to pursue teaching as a career. Educational loans will be provided primarily to academically talented students, minority students, and students desiring to teach in remote locations or in shortage areas. Payback of the loans will be through teaching service. A total of $600,000 has been appropriated for the 1987-89 biennium to support this program.\r\n\r\nI:\r\n\r\nji\r\n\'I\r\n\r\nb\r\n\r\ni\r\nIi\r\n\\:\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nPennsylvania In 1984-85 the State Department of Education awarded $4 million in grants to local districts for locally-developed efforts to improve instruction through training, to sponsor new programs developed by teachers, and to provide incentives for teachers. Nearly all of the state\'s 500 districts participated in the initial program, which received the same appropriation for 1985-86. (For 1986-87 the state legislature increased the funding to $7 million.) Sixty-seven of the districts developed incentive programs. Allocations were made after local districts submitted a written proposal for approval by the State Department of Education; funds were distributed according to a formula based on a pupil/teacher ratio. With a change in the state administration, the scope of the program was modified for 1987-88. $4 million was provided to promote effective teaching. Districts have been awarded subsidy funding based upon a formula and can use the funds to support such programs as mentor teacher and continuing professional development. No funds have been provided for incentive pay. During 1986-87, the governor presented a $5,000 award to the Teacher of the Year and $2,000 each to eight other finalists. While the Teacher of the Year and the finalists will be selected again for 1987-88, no cash awards will be made. Rhode Island While no statewide career ladder programs are being considered, the Rhode Island Department of Education is developing a performance-based assessment program, with a mentor teacher component as a part of the certification process. The Board of Regents of Elementary and Secondary Education has included $225,000 for this proposal in its current budget request, which will be addressed during the upcoming legislative session. These requested funds would support pilot projects in five districts. Additionally, legislation is being proposed by the State Department of Education to provide for the pilot study. Should the legislation and budget be passed during the session, the Department of Education is prepared to initiate a work group to develop the assessment criteria to be used in the pilots. South Carolina Three incentive programs-Teacher Incentive, Principal Incentive, and School Incentive-continue, according to 1984 legislation. Total funding for 1987-88 for the three incentive programs is about $17 million. All programs use student achievement as a major criterion for the awards. The Teacher Incentive Program has expanded from a $2.2 million project in nine districts to a $12 million program that now involves 44 of the state\'s districts and 60 percent of the state\'s students (up from 40 percent during 1986-87). Funded on a per-pupil basis ($32.20 per pupil), 80 percent is for awards (from $2,000 to $3,000 per teacher) and 20 percent for administration of the program at the district level. The 1984 law called on districts to develop models-a bonus plan, a career ladder, and a campus individual plan. Districts then designed programs according to the models. Based on recent recommendations of advisory groups, including teachers and legislators, the career ladder model is being phased out. It was believed that the career ladder model, as it was being implemented, depended too much on documenting extra activities or work. Advisors called for more emphasis on rewarding teachers for top classroom performance and student achievement improvements, rather than on the extra pay for extra work. All models now have criteria weighted to emphasize performance and student achievement rather than other criteria such as attendance or additional duties. A recent third-party evaluation of the Teacher Incentive Program recommended that the guidelines for the program be more specific; that more technical assistance be available to districts; that State Department of Education-conducted surveys include administrators; and that State Department staff and resources be expanded. The report noted that the application rate was not as high as anticipated, but said that was not unexpected given the fact that it was a performance-based pay system. Further conclusions from the review were that: improvement of teacher evaluation had been a focus of the program; the initial efforts to use student achievement as one part of determining teacher performance were receiving positive comments; and there had been improvements in staff development. Negatives about the program, according to the report, were that the documentation of performance by teachers was too time consuming, and the concept of competition (about\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n20 percent of the teachers receive bonuses) was a problem. The State Department of Education and University of South Carolina have developed two technical manuals to help districts: one is on developing performance evaluation instruments; the other deals with using student achievement in teacher incentive systems. A second effort is the School Incentive Award Program, now beginning its third year. Onefourth of the 248 schools in the state received $6.77 million in awards during 1986-87. Awards are based on schools meeting criteria that include student achievement gain and student and teacher attendance; the achievement gain must be met. Money is distributed to the school for instructional purposes and may be used for materials or equipment. Schools meeting all criteria received $54.79 per pupil. Schools also receive non-monetary awards, such as flags and certificates. Schools are grouped into categories based on background of students and student achievement gains are calculated. A student\'s scores are tracked from one year to the next and grouped at the school level for analysis. This method means that this year\'s first-graders are not compared with this year\'s second-graders; rather, it is possible to determine students\' progress. Schools that have student achievement above what is predicted receive awards. Funding for the program was reduced to $4 million for 1987-88. Six districts in which two-thirds of the schools received awards received an additional $3 per student. During 1986-87, vocational centers were eligible for awards if their sending schools met the student achievement criterion. The awards recognize the contribution of the vocational school in developing academic skills and motivating students. The Principal Incentive Program is now in its second year of pilot-testing. Twenty-eight districts (481 principals representing about one-half of the state\'s principals) are participating this year, compared to nine districts (174 principals) during 1986-87. Funding this year is $1 million, an increase from $600,000 last year. Statewide implementation is scheduled for 1988-89. The program rewards school principals who demonstrate superior performance on a statewide evaluation instrument and productivity, including student progress. Approximately 20 percent of a district\'s principals may receive an annual award of between $2,500 and $5,000. Three models are used-a management-by-results model; an extended evaluation model; and a combination model. In the first model, principals must receive superior evaluations and successfully complete predetermined objectives as determined by a district committee. In the extended evaluation, principals must receive a superior evaluation; additional information, such as teacher and parent surveys, and output data from each school, is used. All principals in the district are ranked; the top 20 percent receive the incentive bonus. In the last model, a superior evaluation is combined with additional evaluation procedures determined by a district incentive committee.\r\nSouth Dakota\r\n\r\nIn 1985 the legislature enacted a career ladder for teachers and administrators, but implementation of the plan was blocked by a petition drive which, although not aimed at the career ladder, effectively thwarted the legislation of which it was a part. Originally, a three-level career ladder certification system would have been created, but that legislation was repealed by the 1986 legislature; provisions related to only the first level in the original ladder were retained in the 1986 law.\r\n\r\nTennessee The 1987 legislature continued the Career Ladder program and increased the funding-from $80 million in 1985-86 to $96.5 million in 1987-88. $85 million is used for salary supplements and benefits; the remainder is used for development and administration costs. 1987-88 is the fourth year of implementation of the program that includes a three-rung ladder for teachers (plus counselors, librarians, and other instructional support personnel), supervisors, and principals. Salary supplements from $1,000 to $7,000 are paid to those named to the ladder. Presently, 39,000 educators are on the ladder, with 6,200 teachers and administrators at the upper levels. Seventyfive percent of all the state\'s teachers are on Level I; about 11 percent are at the upper levels. (Teachers with less than three years of experience are not eligible for the ladder.) Approximately 20 percent of those eligible are on the top two levels. Around three-fourths of those teachers who have applied and been evaluated have been named to the top two levels. Two thousand teachers and administrators have applied to become a part of the ladder in 1987-88.\r\n22\r\n\r\nThe 1987 legislature made several changes in the program. Originally, the program was required for any teacher in Tennessee newly certified after July 1984. Now, career levels I, II, and III are optional for all teachers. The probationary and apprentice levels remain mandatory for beginning teachers (those with less than four years of experience). Two separate licensing/certification tracks were created-the optional career ladder certificate and the mandatory professional license that requires a one-year probationary and three-year apprentice status. Teachers are evaluated by the district during their first four years, and if they are successful, they receive a 10-year professional license. Teachers may voluntarily seek career level I, II, or III based on performance.in the classroom. Career ladder certification has been extended from five to ten years. The legislature defeated proposals that included allowing staff development courses to be taken (in place of classroom evaluation) to move up on the career ladder and allowing all teachers, not just those on career levels I and II, to be eligible for summer work. Committees are currently studying alternative routes to reach the upper levels of the career ladder and extended contracts. A study is also underway that is surveying reactions to the program by the state\'s teachers. Recommendations are to be made before the next legislative session. During 1987, field testing continues on the inclusion of student achievement and attitudes in evaluating the performance of teachers. Information is gathered through the dialogue with teachers and questionnaires completed by the teacher\'s students and principal. Work is also underway on developing assessment techniques for school psychologists and speeCh/language teachers. Texas The fourth year of the Texas Career Ladder Program is underway; total funding has increased. During the first and second years, district instruments were used to place teachers on career levels I and II-teachers at level II receive from $1,500 to $2,000 additional pay. During 1986-87, a statewide instrument was used for determining placement on career levels I and II. Beginning this year, teachers are eligible to move to career level III (based on the statewide evaluation procedures) and receive from $3,000 to $4,000 additional pay. A governor-appointed task force and a panel appointed by the State Board of Education recommended several changes in the program and evaluation process. In March 1987, the State Board of Education revised the appraisal system. Changes included eliminating and combining some of the items in the appraisal process and on the professional growth plan. In June, the legislature amended the original law to reduce the number of annual observations from four to two for teachers on career level II or higher whose last performance scores exceeded expectations. The legislation also allowed grade chairpersons to be observers of teachers in the same building. (The original bill did not allow teachers to appraise teachers in the same building.) The 1987 legislation also calls on the State Department of Education to study the use of student achievement in appraising teachers. A report is to be made to the legislature in 1989. Career level III will be implemented this year. Criteria to move up to level III include advanced academic training (a master\'s degree or appropriate number of hours) and clearly outstanding teaching performance in the previous two or three years of teaching. Teachers who were placed on career level II in 1984-85 are now eligible for career level III. Decisions for moving teachers to level III are made by the district. The program is funded through state and local dollars. The state funding, which is based on average daily student attendance, has increased from $50 per student in 1986-87 to $70 in 1987-88.\r\nUtah\r\n\r\n\\\r\n\r\n/.\r\n\r\n1986-87 was the third year of implementation of the career ladder system in Utah. All of the 40 districts in the state participate in the program, which requires submitting to the State Board of Education a local plan meeting state criteria. The system consists of two major dimensions-horizontal and vertical. Funding is provided for the horizontal dimension for additional paid non-teaChing days beyond the regular school year. The law governing career ladders in Utah prohibits the expenditure of more than 50 percent of each disrict\'s allocation for the horizontal dimension. In 1986-87,39.9 percent of the state appropriation-nearly $13.7 million, which does not include fringe benefits-was expended in this area.\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\nThe vertical dimension involves the advancement of certified instructional personnel on a career ladder based on effective teaching performance. This area includes performance bonuses (focusing on recog.nizing and rewarding teachers for excellence in the classroom); career ladders (a multi-level ladder with placement criteria, performance expectations, and a compensation schedule for placement on a level of the ladder); and job enlargement (extra pay for extra work, such as curriculum development and assisting beginning teachers). The law requires that at least 50 percent of a district\'s allocation be directed toward the vertical dimension. In 1986-87,60.1 percent of the appropriated funds were budgeted for the vertical dimension. The total appropriation for 1986-87 was $41 million, including benefits. The legislature provided the same level of funding in 1987-88, despite fiscal problems in the state. The recommendation from the State Board of Education is to increase funding for 1988-89. Vermont Currently, there is no discussion or action being taken toward enacting statewide performance-based incentive programs. The Department of Education is in the very early stages of approaching such issues as alternative certification, peer evaluation of teachers for certification, improving working conditions, and increasing teacher salaries. It is antiCipated that the State Board of Education will begin addressing these issues over the next few months and that funding to support a limited number of pilot projects may be sought during the next legislative session. Three local districts are in some phase of implementing career ladder or incentive system pilot projects. All are supported through local funding. Virginia The Master Teacher and Pay-for-Performance programs, funded in 1984-86, underwent evaluation by outside consultants which indicated that, despite problems with communication and involvement of teachers and administrators, pay-for-performance plans can work. The State Board of Education has endorsed the concept, but no further action has taken place. The Report o\'f the Governor\'s Commission on Excellence in Education recommends that financial incentives should be provided to districts that develop ways to keep effective teachers in the classroom. Professional responsibilities and requirements for advancement are to be defined. Washington The 1985 legislature approved a Beginning Teachers Assistance Pilot Program and provided funding for 100 mentors to assist beginning teachers in 1985-86. During 1986-87, the number of teams (one mentor to one teacher) increased to nearly 700. Approximately $1.5 million has been appropriated for each year of the 1987-89 biennium for what is now called the Teacher Assistance Program. Currently, 880 teams are being funded. Additionally, other educational personnel, including counselors, nurses, school psychologists, reading resource speCialists, social workers, occupational and physical therapists, and communication disorder specialists, are now eligible to participate in the program. West Virginia The West Virginia Board of Education has established policy guidelines for the Distinguished Teacher Program. In 1985, statewide evaluation guidelines were established; districts implemented evaluation procedures in 1985-86. The purpose of the Distinguished Teacher Program is to reward and recognize outstanding teachers, to improve the status of teaching, and to encourage professional growth. The State Board of Education will establish a state program; districts can adopt the state model or develop their own. Teaching p~rformance is to be the primary criteria for advancement; programs are voluntary; and a review committee, with a teacher majority, will determine eligibility for recognition as a distinguished teacher. The plan is for a oneyear pilot project before full implementation. The program depends on funding from the legislature.\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nWisconsin In 1985-86, the Wisconsin State Department of Education issued guidelines and standards to be used in the development of local district proposals for teacher incentive pilot programs. These pilots could include awards, career ladder, or first-year assistance programs for beginning teachers. Funding of $1 million was provided for the initial two-year period with the possibility of an extension for those participating districts wishing to continue. Eight proposals, involving 35 to 40 local districts, were initially funded and are continuing their pilots this year with a one-year extension of funding at a level of $214,000. No legislation relative to career ladders or teacher incentives is pending at this time. It is anticipated that legislation will be proposed to incorporate the first-year assistance program for beginning teachers into law during the 1989 legislative session. Wyoming Although there was some discussion in 1984 relative to the consideration of merit in teacher . compensation, no statewide action has been taken. While local districts have the flexibility to initiate formal teacher improvement programs, it does not appear that any are currently developing such programs.\r\nState information compiled by Gale F.

Once again, we are taking the lead by being the first teacher / school employee union in the nation to develop and propose a comprehensive educational reform plan that includes a merit pay career ladder. Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative in Teaching is a comprehensive approach designed by educators to meet the needs of education in Florida. It was adopted by delegates attending our 98th Annual Convention. The clear way to improve student performance is through good teachers. We believe that our Career Teaching Program, coupled with an immediate move to reach the upper quartile salary goal, will help us auract and keep the best teachers. This plan will provide theframework to make our public school system the finest .in the nation and we pledge to work with all segments of the community to make this objective a reality.\r\n\r\n~~\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nDuring the past year, improvement of our public educational system has become a national priority. The report of the .President\'s National Commission on Excellence in Education, \"A Nation at Risk,\" set the tone for the long overdue upgrading of our nation\'s schools. Unfortunately, the single issue of merit pay for teachers has dominated the educational agenda with insufficient attention given to other more significant concerns of attracting and keeping the best teachers, providing a positive learning environment and encouraging all students to attain their fullest potential \"Merit Pay\" is a simplistic approach that in and of itself does little or nothing to improve our schools. It is obvious, however, that the public, as well as the Legislature, is concerned that additional pay for meritorious work is a threshold issue in the development of any education reform package. The most recent attempts by the legislatively-established Florida Quality Instruction Incentives Council, where a majority of non-educators are about to make educational decisions that will impact on young people for generations to come, leave us no choice but to develop a comprehensive educational plan, not from an \"ivory tower\" or corporate boardroom perspective, but from the classroom by those who daily face the challenge of educating our citizens of tomorrow. This comprehensive plan, Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative iri Teaching, provides the blueprint for making our educational system the finest in the nation. Over the years, teachers have been saddled with one innovation after another, only to find thatthey usually were underfunded, notfunded at all, or replaced by newer programs before determining if the older ones were successful. FEAj United\'s comprehensive plan, Mandating Excellence Rewarding Initiative in Teaching, seeks to meet one goal: and\r\n\r\nINCREAS~\r\n\r\nSTUDENT ACHIEVEMENT\r\n\r\nthis goal, the following three overall objectives must be rea::hed:\r\n~6complish the State Board education goal to reach the upper quartile by 1985. \'insalaries and educational achievement.\r\n\r\n?L~\"+;f\" and sustain exemplary school programs.\r\nand retain the best teachers. programs and costs are outlined below. We urge the Florida Legislature to plan at its 1984 session. Although not all the provisions may be implein 1984, we believe that complete implementation can be achieved within 3 at which time Florida would be well on its way to becoming the Number I state in the nation. however, that our support is contingent first upon the achievement of upper quartile salary goal, and second, funding of a comprehensive program ;4,eslgned to meet the real needs of education. ;!.;hsllOUld be noted that the special bi-partisan panel named by Congress to consider pay for teachers recently concluded that without substantial increases in basic for teachers, rewarding only a few with merit pay \"will have little impact.\"\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n. OBJECTIVE #1 - ACCOMPLISH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION GOAL TO REACH THE UPPER QUARTILE BY 1985 IN SALARIES AND . EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT\r\n\\;With great fanfare during February, 1980, the State Board of Education first \'adopted its upper quartile goal for the 1981.:83 budget: \"In order to maintain and recruit quality teachers in our public schools in Florida, teachers\' salaries on a statewide basis shall rank in the upper 25th percentile or among the top 12 states in the nation.\" In1981, the State Board of Education delayed full implementation ofthe salary goal so that the upper quartile would be reached by 1985, and it also set policy on student performance, when it said: \"On a statewide average, educational achievement in the State of Florida will equal that of the upper quartile of states within five years, as indicated by commonly accepted criteria of attainment.~\r\n\r\n\'___\'___L,,__ .\'_~_\'__L~==_.\'=========~=\r\n\r\nSince the adoption of the upper quartile goals, student achievement, based upon a variety of indicators, has been steadily rising. During the same time, salaries, unfortunately, have not enjoyed the same gain made by student achievement. In fact, Florida has actually lost ground in comparison to other scates in average teacher salaries. The latest breakdown of Florida\'s 476 National Merit Scholarship students show that only 5 are considering teaching as a career. The overwhelming reason given by the state\'s top students for bypassing teaching as a profession was long hours and low pay. . Consequently, the first order of business m.ust be to fund the money necessary to reach the upper quartile salary goal by 1985, as set by the State Board of Education. Salaries of Florida teachers are $3,400 below the average teacher salary ofthe 12th ranked state.\r\n$306 million, plus an additional $55 million in social security and retirement matching, will be needed for the state\'s 90,000 teachers to reach the upper quartile salary level.\r\n\r\nâˆ‘ Increase the number of teacher aides âˆ‘ Initiate pilot programs to improve alternative education âˆ‘ New exemplary programs to encourage school level excellence âˆ‘ Provide salary increases to the classified school personnel, plus social security and retirement matching\r\n\r\n$40 million\r\n~20\r\n\r\nmillion\r\n\r\n$35 million\r\n\r\n$118 million\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that upgrading the physical plant, air conditioning and other similar features are necessary to establish a positive learning environment, however, they must be dealt with separately.\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\nOBJECTIVE #3 - ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE BEST TEACHERS\r\nCareer Teacher Program FEA/ United recommends the establishment of the Career Teacher Program to provide for professional growth and development. The Career Teacher Program contains four levels of teaching classification: Apprentice Teacher, Senior Teacher, Associate Master Teacher and Master Teacher. Movement on the Career Ladder from one level to another is dependent upon successful performance in the current level, additional training as part of a planned program and favorable recommendations by a team of evaluators.\r\n~\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\nOBJECTIVE #2 - IDENTIFY AND SUSTAIN EXEMPLARY SCHOOL PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nIn order to recognize outstanding school programs, it is necessary for the state to provide funds to the school districts for: (a) recognizing schools which develop and implement programs that promote academic excellence and improved student performance; and (b) rewarding school employees who participate in and contribute to such programs; and (c) expanding programs that have already been identified as exemplary school activities. Programs designed to recognize exemplary programs in schools should take into consideration the special characteristics, purposes and variables affecting such schools. The following program should be funded to implement the goal and objective outlined above: âˆ‘ Expansion of PREP to K-6 âˆ‘ Enhance Math/Science/Computer Skills\r\n$60\r\n\r\nUnder the Career Teacher Program., employees will continue to be paid under salary schedules negotiated in collective bargaining contracts. Additional compensation for movement on the Career Ladder would be funded by the state to school districts. There will be no limit set as to the number ofteachers in each classification on the Career Ladder. If a teacher meets the qualifications, then he or she will advance. An appeal process will need to be established for those instances where an individual feels that he/she was unfairly denied advancement on the Career Ladder.\r\n\r\nmillion\r\n\r\n$20 million\r\n\r\nCAREER TEAC\r\n\r\nR PROGRAM\r\nTeaching Time: 50% - 75%\r\n\r\nMASTER TEACHER\r\nInstructional Leadership Time: 25% - 50%\r\n\r\nReg.

This will be followed by a period of two-to-four additional years of supervision and assistance. At the end of the 5th year, teachers will be required to meet the qualifications of Senior Teacher, or they will not be permitted to continue teaching.\r\n\r\nLEVEL I - APPRENTICE TEACHER\r\nQualifications: (1) Have achieved minimum of Bachelors Degree in arl accredited school of higher learning; and (2) Successfully completed the Beginning Teacher Test. Compensation: Apprentice Teachers will be paid on the regular teachers\' salary schedule commensurate with educational attainment and prior experience. \" Duties: The Beginning Teacher Program will be expanded to l?roaden experiences so that new teachers will be given maximum opportunity to develop to their fullest potential. Time will\"be allocated for observation of other teachers and assistance will be provided by Associate Master and Master Teachers. The first year will be a full year of internship where the Apprentice Teacher teaches more than 50% of the time. The remaining years of apprentice teaching will include supervision and assistance. By the end of the futh year, an Apprentice Teacher must meet the qualifications of a Senior Teacher, or will no longer be permitted to teach. Normally, Apprentice Teachers will advance to Senior Teacher after the 5th year, but may apply after the 3rd year. This \"Up or Out\" provision is a major feature of the Career Teaching Program. Those teachers who meet the rigorous standards of becoming a Senior Teacher will be recognized as outstanding teachers.\r\n-----\r\n\r\n.\r\n,\r\n\"\r\n\r\nMASTER\'S DEGREE IN FIELD\r\nOne of the requirements of achieving Senior Teacher status will be a Master\'s degree in field. With the establishment of this requirement, the \"Master\'s In Field\" will have to be revamped in most universities to make the degree relevant. Teachers will be reimbursed tuition as an additional incentive to continue training in their field of teaching. \" There will need to be close cooperation with higher education in order to provide programs in locations convenient to teachers to attain Master\'s degree work and training needed for the Career Ladder.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nEVALUATION.\r\nA cooperative management-union trammg program will be developed and implemented to ensure that administrators are trained to evaluate personnel consistently, fairly and objectively. The Team Evaluation for advancement on the Career Ladder shall be performed by personnel outside the teacher\'s school. The Team may consist of other school administrators, specialists in the field, university personnel, etc., but it will not include the building principal or peers. Training programs for potential team evaluators must be initiated in ample time to provide sufficient personnel to conduct evaluations needed for experienced teachers seeking to move to senior teaching level during the first year of Career Ladder implementation.\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\nLEVEL II - SENIOR TEACHER\r\nQualifications: (1) Successful completion of at least 3 years as an Apprentice Teacher and been favorably recommended by a panel of evaluators; and\' (2) Received a Master\'s Degree in the field in which the teacher teaches. Compensation: As compensation for meeting the high standards of the Level, an amount of $5,000, in addition to their regular salary, will be awarded to Senior Teachers.\r\nI\r\n\r\nCURRENT TEACHER\r\nTeachers currently teaching will be designated \"Teacher\" and will be paid according to their placement on the regular salary schedule. \"Teachers\" will have the right to retain their classification or to move along the Career Ladder to Senior Teacher; Associate Master Teacher, or Master Teacher. Those choosing toâˆ‘ advance must meet the established qualifications for each classification.\r\n\r\nDuties: Teachers achieving the classification of Senior Teacher will be recognized as outstanding teachers. Senior Teachers will be employed on a ten-month contract and will be assigned teaching responsibilities 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nLEVEL III - ASSOCIATE MASTER TEACHER\r\n\r\nCOSTS FOR THE CAREER TEACHER PROGRAM\r\n\r\nQualifications: (I) Successful completion of at least 3 years as a Senior Teacher; (2) Completion of additional training as part of a planned program and be tested on the training; and (3) Favorably recommended by a panel of evaluators. Compensation: Associate Master Teachers will be compensated with $5,000 above the Senior Teacher level, in addition to the regular salary schedule, and also receive an extra 10% of regular salary for the lith month of employment. Duties: Associate Master Teachers will continue to devote most of their time (from 75% - 100%) to teaching, but will be utilized in the development of curriculum and other instructional leadership responsibilites.\r\n\r\nâˆ‘ Training for Principals to Evaluate Personnel . cooperation with the union.\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nA j oint program in $10 miUion\r\n\r\nâˆ‘ Tuition Reimbursement - To encourage teachers to get Master\'s Degrees in field and thus get up-to-date training in their teaching areas. $4 million âˆ‘ Outstanding Student Scholarship Plan - Payment of full cost of college education for outstanding students to enter teaching.

FEA/ United\'s support, however, is contingent upon the enactment of an overall reform program, including money for upper quartile goals. Anything else will be simply a peacemeal approach and will be doomed to failure. The National Commission on Excellence in Education concluded that, \"If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war ... We have, in effect, been committing an act of unthinkable, unilateral educational disarmament.\" In light of that statement, FEA/United\'s Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative in Teaching should be viewed as a battle plan to regain our past commitment to education and win the war over ignorance. The Career Teacher Program, coupled with achieving the upper quartile goals and development of the Outstanding Student Scholarship Plan, will have provided the vehicle for turning around the 30-year drift away from attracting the \"brightest and the best\" into the ranks of teaching. It will provide the incentive for talented young people to receive a college education with the end result of getting the best minds into the classrooms. As this overall plan is developed more fully, it will be necessary to deal with many related issues such as certification requirements. We urge that a complete review of the teacher certification law, in light of this proposal, be undertaken prior to legislative sunset in 1985. Provisions must also be made to re-examine the traditional roles of administrative and quasi-administrative positions, where some responsibilities for instructional lea\'dership rna y now shift to functions of teachers in the Career Teacher Program. FEA/ United prides itself for having been on the cutting edge of change throughout its 97-year history. Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative in Teaching puts us once again at the forefront of change. We believe that it will provide for professional growth, recognize and reward outstanding performance and inspire excellence in our classrooms.\r\n\r\n'),(5373,74,2,49,0,'Education Reform'),(5374,74,2,41,0,'A  contract aimed at providing teachers with a stimulating professional enviroment and students with an improved education.'),(5375,74,2,39,0,'Rochester Teachers Association (AFT)'),(5376,74,2,48,0,'Rochester Teachers Association,.

Under the Rochester contract, beginning in 1988, teachers\' salaries will rise by more than 40% over the next three years. Last year, Rochester teachers started at 518,983 and in three years a beginning teacher will start at $28,935. This increase of 52.4 percent will mean that Rochester will be able to financially compete for the \"best and brightest\"colle~e graduates. In addition to the salary increases, the contract embodies a Career in Teaching Program, which takes teachers from the pOSition of Intern (first year teachers working under outstanding teachers> to Resident 0-4 years of experience) to fully-licensed Professional. Movement along the ladder is not automatic, and Lead teachers will have the opportunity to earn up to $68,500 per year. This is a voluntary program through which teachers can advance both financially and profeSSionally. While they are serving as Lead teachers, individuals will have to agree that for two years thereafter, they will not seek superViSOry or administrative posts. In other words, in exchange for the high salaries, Lead Teachers in Rochester will commit themselves to staying in the classroom. In addition, at least SO percent of their time will be devoted to teaching, with the remaining time given to work as mentors to new teachers, as intervention teachers or other leadership roles. For the first time, teachers will have an attractive career path available to them that does not force them to leave teaching. Lead and Professional teachers will tak~ assignments on the basis of need; they will handle the most difficult classes. Class sizes will be smaller in lower grades and the agreement also modifies the usual system of teacher transfer through seniority. Instead of strict seniority, a .faculty committee in each school will interview and examine the record of teachers who wish to transfer and make a decision on the basis of the needs of the school.\r\n\r\nThe Contract as a Beginning of Educational Change\r\nIn January, 1988, the University of Rochester, along with the Rochester Teachers Association/ AFT, the Rochester School Board and other leading educational agencies, has formed the Wilson Task Force to help monitor the progress of education reform in the region. The task force has since established a program to create professional development sites for teachers at individual schools.

The recommendations, contained in a rep6rt called \"A Region Prepared,\" have been fashioned in response to both national and local calls for reform. They are the work of the Wilson Task Force, commissioned in october 1986, as a project made possible through a grant to the Graduate School of Education and Human Development, University of Rochester, from the Marie C. and Joseph C. Wilson Foundation of Rochester. New York State Commissioner of Education Thomas Sobol will be the keynote speaker at the Wilson Task Force Meeting on Jan. 5. He will talk about the state\'s role in local education reform. Representatives from the Wilson Task Force also will speak briefly about their contributions to the \"Region Prepared\" report, and about ways they will translate proposals into action. Task force speakers will include Dennis O\'Brien, president, University of Rochester; John Van De Wetering, president, State University of New York College at Brockport; James McCuller, executive director, Action for a Better more âˆ‘ âˆ‘ âˆ‘\r\n\r\n-2-\r\n\r\nCommunity, Inc.; Adam Urbanski, president, Rochester Teachers Association; and Peter McWalters, superintendent, Rochester City School District. The task force worked to translate and adapt national school reform initiatives to Rochester\'s specific needs. The recommendations address such matters as curricular reforms, greater involvement of parents in the educational process, the reprofessionalization of teachers, recruitment of a more racially and culturally diverse group of educators, and making teachers more accountable. Their recommendations have been fashioned in response to such major national reports as the National Commission on Excellence in Education\'s A Nation at Risk and the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy\'s A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century. In Rochester, the Center for Educational Development and the Rochester Urban League have helped raise the consciousness of the community to the need to improve education for city schoolchildren in their report, A Call to Action. The Wilson Task Force will also announce on Jan. 5 an important step toward implementing their recommendations: The formation of the Rochester Education council, which will choose the first elementary and secondary schools in Rochester where new programs are introduced and tested. Organizations which have joined the council include: Association of School Administrators of Rochester; City School District of Rochester; Community Roundtable; Industrial Management Council; Nazareth College of Rochester; New York state Education Department; Rochester Teacher Center; the Rochester Teachers Association; the state University of New York College at Brockport; State University of New York at Geneseo; and the University of Rochester. # # #\r\n\r\n-3-\r\n\r\nSOME CURRENT INITIATIVES OF THE ROCHESTER EDUCATION COUNCIL IN THE ROCHESTER CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT: --Administrators and teachers negotiate a path-breaking contract with beginning pay at nearly $29,000 and top pay at nearly $70,000. Contract contains many new incentives that will \"reprofessionalize\" teaching as an occupation, including a four-step career ladder; peer assistance and review; teacher participation in school planning and management and staff-set goals for improved student performance. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER: --Master teachers from the Rochester City school District have faculty status as they train prospective teachers under the Adjunct Instructor\' in Teacher Education Program. --Teacher Institute brings teachers and faculty together to study key educational issues such as critical thinking and literacy. --University provides fifth-year scholarships for minority undergraduates who pursue a graduate degree in education. AT SUNY BROCKPORT: --Mentor program matches minority college students with urban high school students. AT NAZARETH COLLEGE OF ROCHESTER: --A \"Stay in School partnership Program\" matches 20 graduate students with 50 ninth-graders from urban high schools who are at risk of dropping out. AT THE N.Y. STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: --Regents and education commissioner hold 14 working sessions in the fall of \'S7 to discuss with school administrators, teachers and community leaders how to encourage students to complete high school. --State sponsors new programs to increase minority representation in higher education and in the professions. The Science and Technology Entry Program (STEP) and the Stay in School Partnership Program are two examples. AT THE ROCHESTER INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT COUNCIL: --The council provides industry leaders and financial backing for the Program for Rochester to Interest Students in Science and Math (PRISM). This program identifies black and Hispanic youths who are candidates for technology-oriented careers, and assists them in getting the educational preparation they need. --The council contributes leadership and financial backing for the Rochester Brainpower Program; goals are to \"reprofessionalize\" teaching; find jobs to reward educational achievement; enhance the image of education and teaching through a public relations campaign.\r\n\r\n-4-\r\n\r\nSOME KEY POINTS OF WILSON TASK FORCE REPORT, ABEGION PREPARED Recommendations --Each student must have a mentor who is directly accountable for ensuring that the \"system\" helps that child reach full potential. --Individual schools should have more freedom to set goals for performance and improvement, and to decide how to meet those goals. --Educators must have greater rights and responsibilities; decision making must occur as close to the student as possible, and should be free of bureaucratic restraints. --Teacher training programs need to be overhauled so that graduates are more competent to educate students who are currently underserved by traditional schooling. --Effective recruitment programs to attract outstanding racially and culturally diverse candidates need to be in place. Planned actions --Create Rochester Education Council to implement recommendations and foster close contact between professionals in elementary and secondary schools and faculty at institutions of higher education. --Designate some Rochester elementary and secondary schools to become exemplary models for improvements in curriculum, professional development of educators, and operational structures of schools.\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared Recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Each student must have an educator who acts as a \"mentor\" or \"advocate,\" thus ensuring that each child is dealt with as an individual who has special needs. The student\'s \"mentor\" will be directly accountable for the ensuring that the \"system\" helps each child reach his or her full potential. 2. We urge that the constituent community of a particular school be given greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability for improving its school. 3. Each professional must have greater individual rights and responsibilities. If educators are to be responsive to and responsible for the progress and well-being of students, decision-making must occur as close to the student as possible and be free from unnecessary bureaucratic restraints. 4. Enhance professional development opportunities. The existing system leads to isolation of the practitioner and to the denial of the educators\' fundamental role as learner. It is important that students recognize the educator as a continuous learner. S. Educators need options for varied roles during their professional career. 6. Overhaul educator preparation programs so that graduates are more competent to educate students who are currently underserved by traditional schooling. At the same time, ensure that schools, colleges, and universities do not function in isolation from one another. 7. Establish professional working conditions. Quality teaching and learning require a physical environment, cooperative interpersonal relationships, and atmosphere conducive to education. . 8. Modify internship experiences to ensure that attention is given to the educational problems of the students who have traditionally been underserved. It is only as educators become more aware of the child\'s world and their community that they can assist students in making connections from schools to the larger world. 9. Institute collaborative and effective recruitment programs to attract outstanding racially and culturally diverse candidates. 10. Analyze policy from the standpoint of its actual impact on underserved students. Governmental regulation, contractual agreements, and the mores of a school or district often affect decisions and work against the effective education of children. 11. Increase the responsibility of all educators to meet the academic/intellectual needs of each student. High rates of failure must be seen as unacceptable. Success for each student must be recognized as the goal of each teaching/learning interaction. 12. Strengthen the thinking and decision-making skills of students. The fundamental \"basic\" skill required for participation in our complex society is the ability to make sound decisions.\r\nUniversity of Rochester January, 1988\r\n\r\nA REGION PREPARED\r\n\r\nA RESPONSE BY ROCHESTER AREA EDUCATORS TO The Center for Educational Development and the Rochester Urban League Report A CALL TO ACTION\r\n\r\n\"Over the last several months nearly one hundred educators from area educational institutions, as well as representatives from civic organizations and the business community, have been involved in developing a design for improving education which, in the considered judgement of the participants, has potential for achieving fundamental, lasting improvements in the way we educate Rochester\'s young people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Task Force and its report A Region Prepared was made possible by a grant to the Graduate School of Education and Human Development, University of Rochester, from the Marie C. and Joseph C.

She was assisted by Jeanne Sullivan, Graduate School of Education and Human Development, University of Rochester.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\n\r\nBacklround\r\nTwo educational movements, building over the last several years, have lead to this report. The first of these, national in scope, identifies major pathologies in the ways our nation\'s elementary and secondary schools function, in particular, the ways in which our country\'s schools fail to educate increasing numbers of our children. Dozens of major reports such as the National Commission on Excellence in Education\'s A Nation at Risk, the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy\'s A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Centmy, the Holmes Group\'s Tomorrow\'s Teachers, and the National Governors\' Association\'s Time for Results are the products of this movement and describe the wasteful human consequences of not making fundamental improvements in schooling. Recommendations for change contained in these reports have been uniformly radical, on the assumption that only major, systemic, and coordinated changes can produce the kinds of schools that educate all children to their fullest . potential. The second educational movement, regional in focus, has grown from the Center for Educational Development (CED)-Rochester Urban League report, A Call To Action, which urged all members of the Greater Rochester community to help improve educational opportunities for City school children. Since its publication many organizations and individuals,including the Rochester School District\'s Secondary Restructuring Study Group, have responded to A Call to Action. The Wilson Task Force and its report, A Re~on Prepared. grows out of both national and local education reform movements. The national reports, while calling for fundamental, structural changes recognize that reform efforts must be adapted to local conditions if they are to be effective. The Wilson Task Force attempted to translate and adapt national school reform initiatives to Rochester\'s specific needs. In addition, the Wilson Task Force took very seriously the recommendations of A Call to Action which urged educators in the region\'s schools, colleges, and universities to fmd new, more effective ways to educate our young people. Thus, A Relrion Prepared is a response to both national and local concerns about improving the quality of education.\r\n\r\nThe Work of the Wilson Task ForCe\r\nOver the last several months nearly one hundred educators (teachers, administrators, counselors, and other professionals) from area educational institutions, as well as representatives from civic organizations and the business community, have been involved in developing designs that have potential for producing fundamental, lasting improvements in the way we educate Rochester\'s young people. The goal which guides our recommendations is the improvement of schooling for all the children of our region, especially for those who have traditionally been left behind. The major means for achieving this goal is to bring about improvements in practice, institutional structures, and policies at those points where direct intervention by professional educators in elementary and secondary schools can significantly improve the educational experience and success of children. However, the Task Force recognized that in order to create schools that emphasize success, innovation, and caring, it was also important to fmd ways to help policy making groups understand their role in facilitating change at the \"grass roots.\"\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Task Force identified twelve areas in which substantial improvements can be made. While we list first those recommendations that stand the best chance to be carried out, the Task Force feels strongly that all twelve recommendations should be fully implemented. For like national and local reform reports, we feel anything less than full implementation is to adopt a band-aid approach.\r\n\r\nRecommendations for Imp[QyinK Education of Children 1. Each student must have an educator who acts as a \"mentor\" or \"advocate,\" thus ensuring that each child is dealt with as an individual who has special needs. The student\'s \"mentor\" will be directly accountable for the ensuring that the \"system\" helps each child reach his or her full potential. Possible associated actions:\r\nDecrease the number of students in each school by adopting a house or cluster model for large schools, and by dividing smaller elementary schools into primary and intermediate organizations. Students need a stable environment to learn and develop. Students should not be allowed to transfer from one school to another during the school year. Students should have a say in choosing their mentor/advisor; this is especially important when an established student - advisor relationship is not productive. Parents should be part of a school\'s decision-making process. To be effective advocates parents, need to be trained in the dynamics of decision making. Positive steps should be taken to inform the COmIilunity about their decision making role in schools. Counseling and counseling networks should be expanded in schools. Peer mentoring, home-based guidance, and case management are programs that should be fully institutionalized. 2. We urge that the constituent community of a particular school be given greater autonomy, responsibility, and accountability for improving its school.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nThe School District should identify the skills and knowledge young people are expected to have acquired by the time they reach the four transitional points of schooling (primary, intermediate, middle schooVjunior high, and high school graduation). Schools should then be given the freedom to create programs and internal organizations to achieve these goals. The school has always been the focus and center of a community. We urge that each school involve those who do not yet see the school as \"theirs.\"\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\nEncourage community resources (churches, social service agencies, etc.) to work more closely with schools to support of students both in and out of school. Each school has its own character and needs. Each school should therefore determine what resources it needs to fulfil its goals and make decisions regarding expenditure of funds . It should be the responsibility of each school community to decide who will flU any vacancies that occur. Schools should be given the flexibility of creating their own accountability procedures as long as they reflect the policies of the district. 3. Each professional must have greater individual rights and responsibilities. If educators are to be responsive to and responsible for the progress and well-being of students, decision-making must occur as close tO\'the student as possible and be free from unnecessary bureaucratic restraints.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nThose educators who are immediately responsible for a child should be given discretion in selecting curriculum, instructional strategies, and materials to be used in reaching the District\'s broad goals. Clarify those areas in which educators and/or buildings do not have autonomy, as well as those areas in which autonomy exists. Educators should take a more active role in helping students and parents make appropriate choices for the following year\'s class assignment(s). Ways should be found to protect students from an educator who no longer wishes to (or is able to) work productively with young people. 4. Enhance professional development opportunities. The existing system leads to isolation of the practitioner and to the denial of the educators\' fundamental role as learner. It is important that students recognize the educator as a continuous learner.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nEducators should be encouraged to teach courses or units in buildings other that the one to which they are primarily assigned. All educators should have the opportunity to develop and/or participate in conferences and workshops. Procedures should be established to encourage this participation. All educators should have the opportunity to develop and/or participate in peer observation and support activities.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\nInclude within the school day regularly scheduled time for educators to consider professional issues. Involve school-based educators in research and development activities. Procedures should be developed which encourage educators to study and implement the best of current research and practice in the education of their students. 5. Educators need options for varied roles during their professional career.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nProvide for the development of new roles for teachers as specialists in a variety of educational tasks, such as media use, instructional use of computers, community liaison, parent educa~ors, in-service/organizational development, etc. Establish a system of different status and/or remuneration for different responsibilities. Design staff training and development programs to accompany new responsibilities. 6. Overhaul educator preparation programs so that graduates are more competent to educate studentsâˆ‘ who are currently underserved by traditional schooling. At the same time, ensure that schools, colleges, and universities do not function in isolation from one another.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nRedesign responsibilities in colleges and universities so that district-based educators assume roles in colleges and universities (instruction, research, curriculum development, etc.). Create new roles in the schools for higher education faculty, including increased involvement of non-education faculty in the life of schools. Offer new types of learning experiences in higher education, particularly those which are relevant to the world of schools. Develop closer articulation among the various specialties of teacher, counselor, and administrator preparation programs. Consider changes in the traditional location of educators\' and students\' worksites. 7. Establish professional working conditions. Quality teaching and learning require a physical environment, cooperative interpersonal relationships, and atmosphere conducive to education.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nMore effectively use paraprofessionals. senior citizens, business, community,\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n.\'\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\ncollege students, K-12 students, retired educators, parents, etc. Offer easier access to equipment and facilities. Expand the use of technology for recordkeeping. Make creative use of existing buildings. Reexamine the use of time, including the teaching/leaming schedule, and attendance requirements. 8. Modify internship experiences to ensure that attention is given to the educational problems of the students who have traditionally been underserved. It is only as educators become more aware of the child\'s world and their community that they can assist students in making connections from schools to the larger world.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nEducation students, counseling and administrative interns, and others should become fully involved in the life of their assigned school. Internships should be developed for practicing educators at professional development sites and in community, business, and other non-traditional sites. 9. Institu~ collaborative and effective recruitment programs to attract outstanding racially and culturally diverse candidates.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nInvolve school-age students in pre-professional activities. Build consortia-based recruitment arrangements which include regional colleges and universities, local school districts, business, and the community. Provide for significant participation of all educators in the recruitment of new teachers. 10. Analyze policy from the standpoint of its actual impact on underserved students. Governmental regulation, contractual agreements, and the mores of a school or district often affect decisions and work against the effective education of children.\r\n\r\nPossible associated actions:\r\nIdentify laws, policy. and procedures both within and outside the school building and district which work against the effective education of children. Develop and implement plans (such as seeking waivers and variances) which address these constraints.\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\n\r\n\'.\r\n\r\n11. Increase the responsibility of all educators to meet the academiclintellectual needs of each student. High rates of failure must be seen as unacceptable. Success for each student must be recognized as the goal of each teaching/learning interaction. Possible associated actions: Expand purposeful and productive interaction between teachers and supporting professional personnel such as librarians, counselors, deans, psychologists, social workers, and attendance officers. Educators should employ a variety of teaching styles to meet the variety of student learning styles. Develop alternative cmricula which reflect a variety of learning and teaching styles, and which are relevant and meaningful to students. 12. Strengthen the thinking and decision-making skills of students. The fundamental \"basic\" skill required for participation in our complex society is the ability to make sound decisions. Possible associated actions: Students\' educational experiences should include decision-making opportunities both in school and in the larger community. Encourage educators to be models for questioning, critical thinking, and decision-making. Develop and employ a widerange of evaluation approaches and techniques which include opportunities for demonstrating problem-solving abilities. Coach students in order to ensure that they will be successful in these activities.\r\n\r\nTranslatjnl Recommendatjons into Action\r\nRecent history is littered with reports containing numerous recommendations calling for reform or change. Unfortunately, many of these reports\' recommendations. after an initial flurry of interest, are not translated into action. This is a pervasive problem and was recognized as such by the Wilson Task Force. Throughout its meetings Task Force members discussed not only what needed to be done, but how to do it in a way that would result in sustained. institutionalized reform in the education of Rochester\'s young people. During the course of many discussions it became clear that greater participation by all educators and interested groups was needed to help solve pressing educational problems. and that it was especially imponant to foster cooperation between professionals in elementary and secondary schools and faculty in institutions of higher education. The Wilson Task Force decided that two mechanisms should be created to ensure that the group\'s recommendations become a reality. The flrst is the creation of \"Professional . Development Sites.\" The second is the creation of the \"Rochester Education Council.\"\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\n\r\nProfessional DeyelQpment Sites\r\n\r\nWe recommend the creation of Professional Development Sites as a ftrst step toward achieving the fundamental goal of educating all Rochester\'s young people. We have developed a set of procedures which will lead to the designation of selected Rochester area elementary and secondary schools as Professional Development Sites. This, in turn, will enable educators in the Rochester area to create schools which provide exemplary environments for the study, design, implementation, evaluation and dissemination of improvements in:\r\n1. Organizational and operational structures of schooling;\r\n\r\n2. Curriculum, instruction, and other services for our students and their communities; 3. Professional development of present and future educators. Initially, the ftrst of these Professional Development Sites should be located in two or three schools in the Rochester City School District. Taken together, this initial group of sites will cover grades kindergarten through twelve, including programs serving those with handicapping conditions and those serving children of limited English proficiency. Later, additional schools, including suburban and rural schools, will be encouraged to become Professional Development Sites. Educators at the Professional Development Sites will work with other educators from the various institutions to develop plans for their schools which will signiftcantly improve education for their children attending that school. Professional Development Sites are the heart of our recommendations. The ultimate value of what we are proposing will be measured first and foremost by what takes place at these sites.\r\n\r\nRochester Educatjon Council\r\n\r\nWe propose establishing the Rochester Education Council, whose responsibility will be the identiftcation of the ftrst Professional Development Sites, coordination of cooperative initiatives, and the monitoring of progress. The following organizations have indicated their wish to become members of the Council: Association of School Administrators of Rochester, City School District of Rochester, Community Roundtable, Industrial Management Council, Nazareth College of Rochester, New York State Education Department, Rochester Teacher Center, the Rochester Teachers Association, State University of New York College at Brockport, State University of New York College at Geneseo, and the University of Rochester. Each of these institutions or organizations have endorsed the principles described in this document. Membership on the Council requires a fonnal commitment from the governing body of each institution or organization. The chief executive offtcer will select an official representative to the Council. Responsibility for coordinating the work of the Council with the parent body belongs to the representatives of member institutions.\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\nProcess for IdentifyjnK the Initial Professional Deyelopment Sites Each prospective site will develop a plan which reflects the unique needs of those schools. This process should result in schools which are more distinctive, rather than more alike. The site plan should include the following elements:\r\n1. School portrait, in which the site describes the nature of the school as it currently exists;\r\n\r\n2. Detailed plan of action, which describes what the Professional Development Site hopes\r\nto become; 3. An evaluation plan, which shows explicitly how it intends to demonstrate its accomplishments; 4. Active involvement of the site\'s educators and community in the development of its plan; 5. Outline of an outreach, dissemination, and implementation program. Resource Requirements Two catagories of resources will be needed in order to successfully carry out the design of the Wilson Project: resources of the eleven charter institutions represented on the Rochester Education Council which would be directed toward the project, and additional resources necessary to hire and support a full-time director of the project Institutional Resources. By agreeing to become a charter member of the Rochester Education Council, each of the eleven organizations agrees to make a significant commitment of resources to carrying out the projeclThe defmition of \"significant\" will be determined by each organization, and will differ from organization to organization. In addition, each organization will identify an individual who will serve as that organization\'s representative to the Rochester Education Council. Additional Resources. The Rochester Education Council will seek additional resources for the project. In cooperation with representatives from the Marie C. and Joseph C. Wilson Foundation, the Council will seek ftrst to attract support from local and national foundations which have demonstrated commitment to improving elementary/secondary education. The precise ftnancial requirements and requests will be determined by the Council.\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nA Region Prepared\r\nWilson Task Force Participants\r\nThe following people took an active part in the preparation of this document: Barbara Agor, Assistant Professor, University of Rochester Anne Allen, Teacher, Monroe Junior-Senior High School, City School District Zelda Anson-Crichlow, Consulting Teacher (elementary), City School District Robert Burgos, Puerto Rican Youth Division Ruth Danis, Project Management and Grants, City School District Beverly Davis, Director, Office of Staff Development, City School District Dan Drmacich, Resource Teacher, School Without Walls, City School District Ruth Fleischmann, Executive Director, Marie C. and Joseph C.

The ideas presented are tailored to specific needs of the Toledo district. Fifteen states now have state-wide career ladders or pilot projects; another fourteen, including Ohio, have established mechanisms for developing such programs1. None of the ladders in place are working satisfactorily, and those in Florida, Tennessee, and Alabama have been in serious trouble because of strenuous opposition from teachers. Each of these three states has gone through \"re-tooling\" phases in an effort to save its career ladder concept. Poor planning seems to be a standard feature of existing career ladder programs, as well as misconceptions about the purpose of career ladders. The need to develop career options for teachers is real, however. Forty to fifty percent of America\'s teachers will retire or leave teaching in the next seven to ten years. These are conservative estimates, and although Toledo\'s demographic data do not fall into the national pattern, shortages in math, special education, and science are already evident. The number of individuals needed to staff American schools will require colleges to more than double the number of students who currently choose teaching as a career, In 1981, 1,400 science and math teschers were awarded S.A. degrees. There are over 15,000 school districts in the United States. During the 1982-83 school year, 18,000 science and math teachers stopped teaching2. Nationally, eight percent of the teaching force has only four years or fewer experience. A teaching career must be made more attractive. Money alone will not entice talented young people to the classroom although leading researchers of the problem, such as Rand, the Carnegie Foundation, the Holmes group, and almost all individual resear.chers, agree it is imperative that teaching pay be brought into line with professions competing for talented undergraduates. What is also clear in all the research is that teachers must be professionalized to make the job appealing 3 . Opportunity for professional growth and added responsibilities must be made available to teachers in order to attract and hold good teachers. While there are various suggestions about what schools should look like in the future, a change in the role of the teacher is the key to professionalization; professionalization and pay are the keys to maintaining public schools acceptable to the public and adequate for national needs in the near future.\r\n\r\n@\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nThe Carnegie Task Force Report, \"A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21 st Century,\" calls for reforms that seek full professionalization of teaching as well as the restructuring of schools. Opportunities for professional development, control of instructional responsibilities, and greater compensation are at the heart of Carnegie\'s vision for the profession. Carnegie recommendations that mesh with concepts Toledo has created for its Career Development Plan include 1. 2. 3. Teachers need to be given the discretion and autonomy that invariably mark professional status. Most teachers need to be provided with support so they can be more effective and productive. New approaches to school leadership need to be tried, especially those that put teachers at the center of the instructional program. Districts should foster collegial styles of decision-making with \"Lead Teachers\" playing a central role. The range of teachers\' salaries should be increased to those of other professions with. comparable education, training, and experience.\r\n\r\n4. 5.\r\n\r\nMost of these Carnegie recommendations were unknown to us when we developed the basic concepts of the Toledo Career Development Plan. It is apparent, however, that the two designs have common assumptions and many similar characteristics. The Toledo design is based on a professionalization reform already in place - the intern/intervention programs with their heavy emphasis on peer review\'. Peer review has been accepted by Toledo teachers and administrators. It is an example of a teacher-management shared governance responsibility (inducting quality new teachers to the district and assisting tenured teachers identified as performing below accepted district standards), normally not found in public schools. Our Career Development Plan relies on peer review to identify excellent teachers who would then have opportunities to share responsibility for developing and implementing educational projects for the district. The identification of talent and the opportunity to use that talent to address district needs is central to the concepts that follow. Ideas developed by Carnegie or the Holmes Group will help us shape and refine our local efforts in the future, and some of this design might be useful to various national and state planning efforts currently under way. The plan outlined in this document assumes continuation of the traditional salary schedule. Voluntary access to the Career Development Plan is intended to encourage excellent teaching by all staff members, to discover and utilize talents in ways not now\r\n4\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nThe Carnegie Task Force Report, \"A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century,\" calls for reforms that seek full professionalization of teaching as well as the restructuring of schools.

All teachers who qualify through an induction process will enter the program and will be given the opportunity to progress through the various levels by meeting the established minimum requirements. These four levels will be designated as Commendation Level, Green Level, Blue Level and Red Level. During the Qualification Year each applicant to the plan will earn a \"ranking score\" based on an interview, references, a written submission, a test, and peer observations. ThOle applicants at or above a predetermined cut-off score will be accepted Into the program for the Induction Year provided clallroom performance meets established standards. During the Induction Year the candidates will attempt to qualify for the Green Level, or they may choose to qualify for the Commendation Level. Success will be determined by intensive peer review in addition to a project assigned by a governing board for those attempting Green Level status. Advancement to the blue and red levels is based on prescribed educational requirements and various duties assigned by the governing board in addition to successful peer review at the Green Level.

All teachers employed on a regular contract subsequent to January 1, 1984. who have not previously gained tenure in North Carolina schools, will be required to participate in the Teacher Career Development Program. 2. At least 150 presently tenured CMS teachers will be selected as the initial cadre of career candidates. 3. In the immediate future (the next 3-5 years), new teachers who do not have tenure in North Carolina schools will be advised that the expectation is that they will normally not receive tenure until the end of the fifth year of teaching and some may not receive tenure until the end of the sixth year. 4. For new teachers who have not been previously tenured in North Carolina schools. granting tenure carries with it the granting of career level 1 status in the system. 5. For teachers who have previously been tenured in North Carolina schools. tenure decisions in CMS will be made by the end of the second year of employment. However, for these persons the granting of tenure does not carry with it the granting of career level 1 status. 6. Among present employees, only persons who hold tenure in CMS will be eligible to be considered for admission to career candidacy in the new system. 7. Present employees who do Rot have tenure and who subsequently gain tenure and future employees who gain tenure under the present conditions of the Fair Employment and Dismissal Act (i.e., teachers who are employed with tenure in North Carolina schools) will be eligible to apply for candidacy upon the receipt of tenure.\r\n,-\r\n\r\n8. It should be the goal of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to assure that all persons who are presently employed (including those who do not have tenure) be provided the opportunity to undergo the training and evaluation necessary to qualify for career I status before persons subsequently employed are eligible to gain this status. 9. The present advisory/steering committee and liaison structure should remain in place for at least five years. The purpose is to provide for monitoring the implementation process, identifying problems that emerge as a result of implementation. and suggesting possible solutions to the Superintendent. 10. Present teacher .embers of the advisory/steering committee will be precluded from applying for candidacy for career atatusfor the 1984-85 school year. However. five of the nine teacher members of\r\n\r\n---- --------....:......\r\n\r\n__ ____ .___ .. _4_ ._i .âˆ‘. __ __ . __ . __ .\r\n~\r\n\r\n_._. _ . _____ âˆ‘.. ___ . _ .âˆ‘ -_. \'\" ._._-.............\r\n~\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n\"\r\nJ\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n. the adviaory/ateering committee will be\' replaced by career level I teachers for the 1985-86 achool year and the four remaining teachers will be replaced by career level I teachers for the 1986-87 school year. 11. Present teacher members of the advisory/steering cOmmittee will enjoy no special advantage or disadvantage in being selected as candidates other than a) none will be eliglble to be candidates during the first year and b) four will not be eligible for candidacy during the second year. 12. In recognition of the disadvantage of late application, present teacher members of the advisory/steering committee will receive a salary equivalent to the salary they would receive if they were career level I teachers during the period they serve on the advisory/steering committee. However~ it is understood that these teachers are to be replaced by career level I teachers. Serving on the\' committee is as,swned to be a normal duty for a career level I teacher and therefore no stipend will be paid. 13. As career level I teachers become available, it is expected that one of their normal duties is to serve on a school liaison committee. 14. The advisory/steering committee and other persons designated by the Superintendent will meet at\' least once each year to review progress and address emerging problems.\r\n\r\nIS. Chairpersons of liaison committees will meet at least twice each year (at an area level) to review progr~ss, identify problems, and react to proposed solutions.\r\n16. In addition to the annual meeting indicated in number,14 above, the advisory/steering committee will meet at least four times per year to review progress, identify problems. and propose solutions. Recommendations Regarding Evaluation and Training of New Teachers 1. All teachers who have not previously gained t~nure in North Carolina sc~ools and who are employed on a regular contract subsequent to January,âˆ‘ 1 , 1984, will be designated as prOVisional teachers. 2. Decisions regarding continued employment and/or advancement to career nominee status will be\'based upon an assessment of documented evidence that the provisional teacher has demonstrated the possession of specified competencies (see Appendix A) which have been determined to be associated with the capacity to perform in outstanding ways in the classroom âˆ‘ 3. No person will advance from proviSional status to career nominee status until a) the possession of the specified competencies has been clearly demonstrated and b) until the person has been certified as per the provisions of the state\'s Quality Assurance\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n3\r\nI\r\n~\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nProgram. It i. expected, therefore, \"that new teachers will serve in a . provisional .tatu. for two year âˆ‘âˆ‘ 4. Persons who have not demonstrated the expected competencies by the end of the second year of employment will be terminated. Termination prior to the end of the second year may also occur if evaluations indicate that the provisional teacher is not likely to develop the competencies and skills required for outstanding performance in the classroom âˆ‘\r\n\r\n. S. As a part of the condition of employment, new teachers will be required to sign aâˆ‘document indicating a) their understanding of the special provisions for gaining tenure in eMS b) their willingness. to participate in the forms of evaluation and training prescribed.\r\n6. The primary unit responsible for the assessment and direction of provisional teachers will be a three person committee made up of the principal, the assistant principal for instruction, and one experienced teacherâˆ‘ designated by the principal to serve as a mentor for the provisional teacher. (Normally, it is expected that the experienced teacher will come from the school in which the provisional teacher is assigned. As career level I, II, and III teachers become available, it is also expected that these persons will form the pri~ary pool from which mentors will be drawn. However, if in the principal\'s judgment there are no persons available in the school who could appropriately serve as a mentor, an outside teacher will be requested to serve as mentor.) Hereafter, this group will be referred to as the assessment/advisory team. 7. The evaluation criteria used with all beginning teachers will be a specified list of competencies which have been identified as important to assure that one has a maximum chance of developing into an outstanding teacher. (This competency list is still in the process of development, but a preliminary list is attached in Appendix A.) 8. During the first aemester of employment, the evaluations will be informal, but intenaive. a. Prior to the beginning of the school year, the new teacher will meet with the assessment/advisory. team to review the competencies expected and to engage in a preliminary assessment of the teacher\'s knowledge and skills in these areas. Based on this review, the assessment/advisory team will develop a preliminary observation and conSUlting schedule. The purpose of this schedule will be to confirm that the individual in fact possesses the skills and knowledge that th. preliminary assessment indicated were present and to develop skills and knowledge that appear to be lacking. It is intended that the new teacher will be observed and/or participate in a formal conference centered on one or more of the specified competencies at least once each week. Logistically, the responsibility for such observations and\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\nc.\r\n\r\n.j\r\n\r\n.--.--- ..... . -.-, ......\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n----~\r\n\r\n.... -\r\n\r\n.._......... .\r\n\'\r\n\r\n4\r\nI\r\n\r\ncOllf.r.nces will be asa1,n.d to the ...s.ssment/.~visory team .nd to other persons as well (e.g âˆ‘âˆ‘ other teachers in the school. curriculum specialists. inservice specialists, and oth~r professional personnel who seem to be appropriate). It viII b. the responsibility of the principal to .ssur. that personnel assigned to conduct observations are in fact availabl âˆ‘âˆ‘ d. Each person conducting an observation or consulting session will be expected to file with the principal a brief narrative report indicating his/her assessment of the beginning teacher\'s performance and/or progress. In addition, specific data supporting the assessment should be reported. (Observers and consultants will, of course, be trained in the preparation of such reports.) At least once every six weeks, the full assessment/advisory team will meet with the beginning teacher to review reports, assess progress, and make necessary adjustments in the conferencing schedule. Near the end of the first semester, the assessment/advisory team will meet with the beginning teacher to hold a summary conference and to specify future directions. At this time, other persons with staff development responsibility may be asked to participate in the conference since one of the purposes of the conference will be to develop a more formalized training and support program for the beginning teacher. .\r\n\r\ne.\r\n\r\nf.\r\n\r\n. 9. During the second semester of employment, the process described above will be continued. In addition, three formal observation/evaluations will be conducted by three trained and system-verified observer/evaluators. During the first semester, beginning teachers will be provided instruction regarding the nature of the formal evaluation process. The results of these observation/evaluations plus the data contained in the informal observation materials will be used as the evidence to support or refute the propOSition that the beginning teacher has made satisfactory progress in developing the competencies required to warrant co~tinuation as a second year teacher. 10. In early April, the assessment/advisory team will meet to assess the beginning teacher\'s progress to date and to develop a preliminary recommendation of whether the beginning teacher has a) demonstrated satisfactory.progress to warrant continuation as a - provisional teacher or b) failed to demonstrate satisfactory progress and therefore termination is advised. 11. Subsequent to this aeeting, âˆ‘the principal, and at the suggestion of the principal, other members of the team will meet with the provisional teacher to discuss the team\'s decision and the data\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n~:\r\n\r\nt.âˆ‘.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\\\r\n\r\n. ...\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nbase from which th. decision derived. At thii time, the teacher will be invited to write a self appraisal responding to the team\'s assessment. In c âˆ‘âˆ‘âˆ‘âˆ‘ where termination is recommended the self assessment plus the team\'. recommendation will be forwarded to the area review committee for action. (The action of this team will parallel the actions taken for experienced teachers except that the question before the area level review committee will be focused on specified competencies instead of generalized expectation\".) 12. In those cases where the assessment/advisory team recommends termination or advancement to career nominee status, the recommendation will be forwarded to an area level review committee (see below). The recommendation report should indicate the specific date upon which the recommendation is based. Furthermore, the recommendation should be especially attentive to the contents of the observation/evaluation reports. 13. The area level review committee comprised of the Area Superintendent or his/her designee, a principal from a school other than the one at which the teacher is assigned, the Assistant Superintendent for Personnel Services or his/her designee. an appropriate curriculum specialist, and a teacher from the teacher\'s assessment/advisory team will review the recommendation and supporting documents. Based on this review, a recommendation will be forwarded to the central review committee. 14. The central review committee will have the obligation of reviewing all recommendations, assuring that uniform procedures have been followed in all cases. Where there is a disagreement between the assessment/advisory team and the area level committee, the central committee will render a judgment concerning how this difference should be reconciled. The final recommendations to the Superintendent regarding the disposition of any case will come from the central review committee comprised of the Deputy Superintendent or his/her aesignee, the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Staff Development or his/her designee, the Assistant Superintendent for Personnel Services or his/her designee, a teacher member from the advisory/steering committee, and an administrative staff member \'from the advisory/steering committee. 15. At present, all new teachers will serve a second year as provisional teachers. The evaluation procedures described above will be employed during the second year with the forlowing exceptions: a. b. c. The informal observations and conferences will be less intensive (once every two weeks) as opposed to once per week. The number of observation/evaluations by outside observers will be increased from three to six. At the end of the second year, all recommendations will be reviewed by the area level and central review committees.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\'.\r\n\r\n. 16. For a person to receive a positive recommendation at the end of the .econd year. two conditions must be met:âˆ‘\r\nB.\r\n\r\nThe data contained in the nine observation/evaluation reports must clearly indicate that the quality of the teacher\'a classroom performance is strong to outstanding 1 âˆ‘ ~ There must be strong evidence that the specified competencies have been demonstrated.\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\n17. To assure that the evaluation plan for beginning teachers can be effectively implemented, the following conditions must be met: a. New te~chers will be expected to participate in a three day training session prior to the beginning of their employment. The purpose of this session will be to orient them toward the expectations of the evaluation system and help them understand what is intended. Other than specific activities suggested by the assessment/advisory team, there will be no training provided for new teachers during the first semester of employment. Experienced teachers who apply for candidacy (see below) will be required to indicate their willingness to serve as mentors for provisional teachers if requested to do so even if they are not selected in the first group of experienced teachers to become candidates. Teachers who are d.esignated as mentors to new teachers will be provided a substitute ~ day per month so that they can observe and consult with the beginning teacher. The assistant principal for instruction (API) will be expected to spend the equivalent of one full day per month with each beginning teacher at his/her school. In those cases in which the number of teachers in an individual school is too great to make this feasible \" alternative arrangements will be made. The principal will be expected to spend ~ day per semester observing and conferring with each new teacher at his/her school. The appropriate curriculum specialist will be expected to spend ~ day per semester with each new teacher. In those cases in which the appropriate curriculum specialist is not available, alternative arrangements will be made. The area program specialist will be expected to spend per semester with each new teacher.\r\n~\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\nc.\r\n\r\nd.\r\n\r\ne.\r\n\r\nf.\r\n\r\ng.\r\n\r\nh. i.\r\n\r\nday\r\n\r\nPrincipals, API\'s, curriculum specialists, and teachers who serve on assessment/advisory teams will be provided a 2-3 day training session in which they are provided instruction in\r\n\r\n\'.\r\n\r\nnt\r\n\r\nd\r\n\r\nS\r\n\r\n\"\'--\"---~\'.\'\'\'\'\'\'\';\'\'\'\'\'\'\'.:\'-.-\r\n\r\n........... ;..-...... -..-\r\n\r\n... -\r\n\r\n.......\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nthe ways and means of preparing useful reports on obaervations and conferences.\r\n\r\ninfo~al\r\n\r\n18. Baaed on the results of evaluations conducted during the first semester of the employment of provisional teachers, API\'s in cooperation with curriculum specialists and under the leadership of the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Staff Development, should design and implement system-wide ana/or area wide training programs designed to develop required competencies that are found to be generally lacking or in need of refinement. In addition, the assessment/advisory teams should prescribe individual experiences intended to overcome deficiencies noted in individual cases. At a minimum, this training should assure the development of the competencies contained in the Effective Teaching Program and the Alcohol Education Workshop. 19. The evaluation of career nominees will parallel the evaluation of second year provisional teachers except that the focus of the evaluation will be broadened to include knowledge and skills that assure the capacity to effectively assume faculty responsibilities that go beyond the classroom (e.g., work on faculty committees, work with parents and community agencies).2\r\n\r\n20. The career nominee will be permitted, if he/she chooses, to select a mentor other than the one assigned during the provisional period with the provisions that: 1) the person selected meets with the approval of the principal, and b) the person selected is a career levell, 11, or 111 teacher. (By the ,time new teachers reach career nominee status, career level 1 teachers and perhaps career level 11 teachers will be available.)\r\n21. Career nominees will continue to be evaluated as they were evaluated as provisional teachers. Each year of nominee status (one to two years) a nominee will undergo at\' least three observation/evaluation sessions with trained outside evaluators. No person will advance from nominee status to career candidate status until it is judged that he/she has satisfactoriiy demonstrated all the competencies listed in Appendix A. Furthermore, no person will be advanced to candidate status until and unless the observation/evaluation \' reports indicate that the quality of classroom performance is outstanding âˆ‘.-.-\r\n\r\n22. As for provisional teachers and career nominees, primary responsibility for the assessment and direction of the candidate will be assigned to a team of teachers and/or administrators. At the recommendation of the candidate and with the consent of the principal, the assessment/advisory\'team assigned during the prOVisional and nominee period could be retained, or the team may be reconstituted. If the team is reconstituted, the following provisions ~ill apply:\r\na. The team shall have no fewer than three and no aore than five members.\r\n\r\n:.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\nIf the principal is not offtcially a -member of the t.am, he/she will continue to seTVe in an ex officio capacity.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n23. Prior to the beginning of school of the first year of candidacy, the advisory/assessment team will meet with the candidate to develop a two year evaluation plan. The intent of the plan will be to cause the candidate to present products that contain evidence of results suggested by the expectation statements. For example. a candidate might propose that he/she will submit a number of teacher made tests to a school system specialist in tests and measurements for critical review and evaluation. Similarly, the candidate might suggest ,that he/she will submit an appropriate unit to a curriculum specialist for review and evaluation. The candidate would also be called on to suggest criteria to be used in the evaluation of these products. The team will review the candidate\'s proposal and make suggestions about any needed additional products or modification of criteria. In addition to the products suggested by the candidate and the team, the candidate will be required to undergo six observation/evaluation sessions with outside observers over the two year period. Recommendations regarding advancement to career level I status will be based on the results of the observation/evaluations and on the evaluation of the other products that the teacher has agreed to provide. 24. As with provisional teachers and career candidates, it is expected that the assessment/advisory team will meet regularly with the person being evaluated for the purpose of a) establishing an evaluation plan, b) monitoring progress, and c) rendering a summative judgment at appropriate points. For the career candidate, these meetings will occur before the beginning of the school year, near the end of the first semester, and near the end of the second semester. 25. The general structure for the evaluation of career candidates will be the same as for the evaluation of provisional teachers and career nominees. Specifically, the assessment/advisory team will be expected to conduct on-going evaluation sessions with the candidate and at the appropriate time to torward a recouquendation for advancement to career status. With the exception of presently employed teachers, no person will be recommended for career level I status until he/she has served at least two years as a career candidate.\r\n--.\r\n\r\n26. ODce one has arrived at candidate status, the focus of evaluation will shift from specified competencies to more global expectations. The critical question will be, \"Is there clear and convincing evidence that the individual being evaluated is meeting the expectations of a career level I. 11. or III teacher?\" Thus, the evaluation system will shift from a competency based evaluation .ystem (i.e âˆ‘âˆ‘ skill. and knowledge) to a results based evaluation ayatem. Furthermore, the\'results of concern are those indicated by the statement of expectations (e.g âˆ‘âˆ‘ teachers should engage in activity that assures that they maintain currency in their field). The evaluative question, therefore. is \"What is the evidence to support the assertion\r\n\r\n::~-:::;\'::.:\'\r\n\r\n:;.;.; ;:. .:.:.:. : :;. . ;..\r\n\r\n~.-==-=-\r\n\r\n=-...;;;=\"\"\",,==.:s..-- -_. ,\" _ ............

For career candidates and career level I teachers, \'the expectations are: a. Maintain mastery of the subject matter he/she is assigned to teach and maintain technical expertise in his/her assigned area of responsibility. Evaluate students in a manner that is consistent with the best available knowledge in the field of evaluation. Provide instruction to students in a manner that is consistent with the best available knowledge in the field of teaching and learning. Manage classroom activities in a way that creates an environment conducive to effective and efficient student acquisition of knowledge. Provide his/her students with maximum access to the human and material resources available in the system and in the community. Recognize and respond positively, appropriately, and with a caring attit~de to students including the handicapped and those from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Establish high expectations for student performance and provide students with those forms of motivation, instruction, guidance, and support that are most likely to assure that these expectations can be met.\r\n\r\nb. c.\r\n\r\nd.\r\n\r\ne.\r\n\r\nf.\r\n\r\ng.\r\n\r\nh.Communicate effectively with staff, parents, and students regarding issues relevant to his/her area of expertise and/or his/her job assignment. i.\r\nj.\r\nPa~ticipate\r\n\r\nin the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the effects and effectiveness of school programs.\r\n\r\nParticipate in and support activity aimed at enhanCing the life of the school and achieving school goals.

For career level II teachers, there are the following ~ tional expectations: a. b. Provide leadership to the staff in identifying and attempting to solve school problems. Develop and maintain skills as an observer-evaluator and be willing to serve in an observer-evaluator role if asked to do ao. Accept new job assignments including accepting temporary moves or transfers if such moves are viewed as necessary to effectively address school problems or improve instructional programs.\r\n\r\nc.\r\n\r\n29. Career level III teachers will be expected to meet all the expectations for career levels 1 and II, and in addition to: a. Provide leadership in the design and conduct of research and development projects aimed at improving instruction including participating in the creation of and testing of alternative curriculum materials and alternative instructional strategies. Provide leadership in the design and implementation of building, area, and system level staff development programs.\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\n30. To advance from career candidate status to career level I status, there must be, in the judgment of the assessment/advisory team and the subsequent review committees that the individual being evaluated is performing in ways that meet the expectations indicated for career level I status. Furthermore. no person will be advanced from career can4idate status until the results of the observation/evaluation reports indicate that the quality of his/her classroom performance is consistently outstanding. 31. Presently employed teachers who are selected as candidates for career level I status will be required to submit to the same evaluation process described above for career candidates with the following exceptions: a. b. The eva~uation plan will be for one year rather than two. y.ars. The observation/evaluation reports will be increased to nine in a single year.\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\n.=;_-\'---== _\r\n\r\n;;,;~:.\';;.:;:._~--:.::-:o;:-_.\r\n\r\n__....\r\n\r\n.o::-;,:;\".=:,;::,;;:-=;,;-.-,.-._-,-=::;;=~\"\"\"\r\n\r\nâˆ‘~\r\n\r\n.\' . =\"\'.\"\'A\':\':\';\".\"\"\"\".\'\"\"\"...,. \"\"\'rt_ _....+\"\"\'~\'\"\"\' .......... \" ......... __\r\n\r\n0;;;:.:\r\n\r\n~-=-\r\n\r\n..âˆ‘ ___ ~ __ ~ .. :._.., .. ,_.\' ........~ -.;,. _....:. . \'.\".âˆ‘.\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n32.

The evaluation cycle for career levelâˆ‘ I teachers will be for three yeara. The evaluation cycle for career levels II and III teachers will be for five yeara; The expectations for career level II and III teachers will differ from those for career level I; Only one observation/evaluation session will be conducted per year except that in the last year of the evaluation cycle. two observations will be conducted.\r\n\r\nRecommendations Regarding Selection Ideally, the selection of career candidates should be based on a systematic evaluation process occurring over a sustained period of time. Ideally, all present teachers who aspire to career level I status should be afforded the opportunity to undergo such an evaluation at the same time. At present, the technical capacity to systematically evaluate all teachers who might wish to seek career level I status is unavailable, and it is unlikely that resources will be available to develop such capacity in the ahort run. Therefore, the following alternative strategy is recommended: 1. 2. All teachers who have tenure in CMSâˆ‘will be eligible to apply for acceptance as a candidate for career level I status. All teachers who apply will be assured that they will have the opportunity at the earliest possible time to undergo the training and evaluation that will determine whether they will be granted career level I status. Persons who apply will not be accepted, unless they agree to comply with .the training and evaluation requirements and unless they are willing to accept the other conditions of aelection described below. Once applications have been received, fellow teachers and knowledgeable administrators will be provided with a carefully constructed questionnaire which calls on them to indicate their assessment of the applicant\'s reputation among _ teachers,. administrators, and parents. For example. an ite~ might be. \"If the Superintendent of Schools said that X is an outstanding teacher, most teachers who know X would a) agree strongl~, b) agree moderately, c) have serious doubts, d) I do not know how other teachers would respond, or e) I do not wish to answer this question.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n(\r\n\r\n-. ----------- _--------_ ..\r\n.\r\n\",\r\n\r\n\".- .-. -\r\n\r\n- .--\r\n\r\n-- .. ....âˆ‘.âˆ‘ - -... - ... ..... ........\r\n\"\r\n\r\n~-\'\r\n\r\n--.~--\'--\'\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n-....................\r\n\r\n~-\r\n\r\n.... .\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nV.inl re.ponses on the questionnaire as the data ba.e, applicants viII be placed in tvo catelories: a) those vith clear reputations for outstandinl performance, and b) those with axed reputations. -.

In addition to the time commitments indicated earlier as necessary to support the evaluation and training of new teachers, the following additional requirements must be met if this program is to be .uccessfully implemented: a. For the 1984-85 school year, it will be necessary to employ nine persons to serve as observer/evaluators and to provide for their training. . It will be necessary to provide a one week training session prior to the beginning of school to orient experienced teachers wbo bave been selected to the expectations the system bas for them and to provide them with the instruction necessary to insure a reasonable probability of .uccess in the program. It will be necessary to provide experienced teachers vho are candidates with one-half release day per month to participate in a formal training program designed to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to aeet the expectations for career level 1 teachers.\r\n\r\nb.\r\n\r\nc.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~.-.\r\n\r\nâˆ‘ . .\'. d.\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nIt viII be necessary to assure teachers who are not selected in the first or early Iroups that they will have an opportunity to participate and that hilh priority will be liven to redirectinl existinl ataff development resources in such a way as to help them move into the Career Development Prolram aa rapidly as possible.

It ianot the purpose of this program toâˆ‘ in any way jeopardize the present basic salary atructure or to threaten future improvements in that structure âˆ‘\r\n\r\n.\r\n\"\r\n\r\n.~\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\nNOTES IThe specific instrument (or instruments) to be used in the assessment of classroom performance has yet to be selected and/or developed. It appears likely, however, that the instrument that will be used is the instrument that is presently being field tested by the State of North Carolina as the instrument to be used in support. of the Quality Assurance Program. The reasons this instrument is likely to be selected are: 1) it would make our evaluation system congruent with the minimum requirements of the state evaluation, 2) the state Classroom Performance Appraisal Instrument is one of the few instruments available that is based on research regarding effective teaching and effective schools, 3) the items of concern on this instrument are consistent with the elements of teaching auggested as important by the Effective Teaching Program presently being implemented in CMS. and 4) since the instrument is being developed in North Carolina, we will have easy and relatively inexpensive access to the forms of training and technical assistance which will assure that the instrument will be effectively and appropriately employed. 2Persons who have arrived at career nominee status should be persons who have already demonstrated they have the knowledge and skills to assure that they are capable of high quality classroom performance. It does not depreciate the significance of classroom performance to suggest, however, that there is more to being a classroom\'teacher than classroom performance. Outstanding teachers are called on to do many things to maintain excellence in a school in addition to those things that maintain excellence behind the classroom door. They are, for example, called on to relate effectively with parents and other teachers. They are expected to be articulate advocates of public education. They are expected to know and uphold the values and goals of the school system. They are expected to understand and implement system-wide policies and procedures. They are expect;d to provide collegial support to other teachers and will eventually be expected to provide collegial support to new teachers. The knowledge and skills that theae expectations require are different from the knowledge and skills required to teach a good lesson. As a provisional teacher, one is expected to develop the knowledge and .kills required to deliver a good lesson in the classroom and thus b~ an effective classroom teacher. As a career nominee, one 11 expected . to develop the knowledge and skills that assure that he/.he will be an effective faculty member as well âˆ‘\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n--1-----:.-_-...---.-\r\n\r\n=~===:::.:==-----\r\n\r\n. . .----.- . . . .__ _ . __. ____.-.-..--\". . . . .__ ._._. __,.__.. .-.- .\'... . .-__. . .-._. ,_~\r\n\r\n----.-\'~-\r\n\r\n11/7 /83\r\n\r\nFact Sheet Charlotte-Mecklenburg Teacher Career Development Programâˆ‘\r\n\r\nThe questions and answers listed below were comPiled as a result of the work of the advisory/steering committee and feedback from liaison committee chairpersons and other professional personnel in the school system. Many of the questions are directly quoted from ,written reports submitted by liaison committees. General Questions 1. What are the basic purposes of the Teacher Career Development Program?\r\ni~\r\n\r\nThe basic purposes of the Teacher Career Development Program are: 1) to deveiop and maintain outstanding teacher performance, 2) to promote effective schools, 3) to advance the pro~ession of teaching, 4) to enhance the credibility of public education, and 5) to assure that the status and rewards teachers receive are commensurate with the high expectations held for them. 2. Is there a quota for the number of persons who are selected to be active for career level 1 status? If so, why is a quota needed?\r\ncandidat~s\r\n\r\n\'.. ,\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\nIn the long run, there will be no quota. Everyone who wants to become career level I will have the opportunity to try. In the short term, however,a quot~ is needed because the training and evaluation procedures will require a large amount of resources both in terms of money and technical capacity. The quota which will be established will depend on the resources available for effectively training and evaluating candidates. The number currently being considered is 150 in the first year. Will all present teachers have a chance to become career level I? Yes, evaluation will have reach that all present teachers will have a chance to undergo the training and required for career level I status. The goal is that all present teachers the opportunity to try for career level I status before any new teachers level.\r\n\r\n- 3.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nWho is included in the Teacher Career Development Program? All prese~t teacher level, tenured personnel who are certified and have,a regular contract willâˆ‘âˆ‘âˆ‘be included if they want to be. All new teachers will be required to be in the program. Eventually, all professional level personnel below the level of assistant superintendent will in some way be involved in the progr8Jl\'. It is not clear at this point exactly how specialists, student services specialists, principals, and assistant principals will be included.\r\n\r\n5. \"\r\n\r\nWhy is there so little emphasis on classroom performance? The emphasiS is and always has been on outstanding classroom performance. However, some of the early documents sent out by the advisory/ateering committee did not communicate this well. In addition to demonstrating outstanding classroom performance, career level I teachers will also be expected to show evidence of meeting expectations held for them in the areas of school performance and professional performance, but these expectations can be met by effective participation on faculty committees and by assuming other responsibilities \'that are even now assumed by outstanding teache~s.\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n:cr;::::\";\";~\':;\"\"I\r\n\r\n.. t\r\n\r\n_r._.__.....__\r\n\r\n\"\'_t.\'..,.... _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _.......;.-;;.;.:0;.:.,;.;.,..:.:.;.,;;;..âˆ‘âˆ‘bO\';;;âˆ‘-;;,.âˆ‘.....âˆ‘ ._~;:...t~Iâˆ‘âˆ‘iâˆ‘ dlfioâˆ‘ \' âˆ‘âˆ‘âˆ‘âˆ‘ âˆ‘. \' âˆ‘âˆ‘;O\" . .\r\n\r\n. ;\'\" i\"- - \':-::..-;.; .\r\n\r\n~.:.;.\r\n\r\n..... .\r\n~\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nWhat are the âˆ‘âˆ‘surancâˆ‘âˆ‘ for the future?\r\n\r\nI. this a fad?\r\n\r\nEven under pr.sent circumstance., there are\'no guarantee. and no assurances for the future. The present Board of EducaU,on. can morally, but not legally, bind a future Board of Education. However, there are ..ny people both inside and outside the system who are giving attenUon to thb program. It is being embedded in a variety of . contexts which will make it difficult for it to be discontinued. The fact that this . school .ystem is taking a proactive .tance in combination v1th the fact that this .program is a pilot program for the state and is receiving national attention as well vould make it very difficult for an enl1ihtened community like Charlotte-Mecklenburg not to support the program!!i! produces quality education.\r\nI\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nWill liaison committee feedback really count? It does count, and it viII count IIOre and more. Based on feedback, the advisory/steering committee has already made modifications in\' what is being proposed.\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nWhy does the advisory/steering committee keep changing its mind? As indicated above, the advisory/ateering committee really does want input from other professional personnel and really does listen to that feedback. The goal is to have the best plan possible. Whenever a better idea 1a brought to the attention of the committee, the proposed plan will be modified in light of that idea.\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nHow will parents feel who have children in non-career level 1 teachers\' classes? In the long run, all teachers will be Career Level I, II, or 111 teachers or in the process of achieving that status. In the short run, parents will need to be informed that experienced teachers who are not Career Level I w111 eventually be eligible to qualify as Career Level I.\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nShould teachers be required to attend meetings held by the liaison committee Rt their school? No. All teachers should be provided with Gny documents sent out [rum the advisory/steering committee, but they should not be forced to participate. The goal is to give all teachers who want to parUcipate in the planning of this program an opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\n\'11.\r\n\r\nWhere does a person stand who is due to receive tenure in 1985? Any pre~ent teacher who does not yet have tenure but who is granted tenure (under the present system) will be treated as all other experienced t.achers. Such a teacher can apply for the opportunity to try for career level I status as soon as he/she gets tenure.\r\n\r\n.\'.\'\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\nWill teachers new to CMS but with tenure in North Carolina take 4-6 years to get tenure?\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\nNo. The Nor~h Carolina law holds. They will get tenure in 2 years or be terminated. Once they receive tenure thef will have the opportunity to apply for Career I Status.\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n13.\r\n\r\nWhat will happen to teachers who come to CMS with experience from another state? For purposes of tenure, these teachers will come in with 0 years of experience just as they do now. On the salary scale, they will be paid in terms of their years of experience.\r\n\r\n14.\r\n\r\nIf it were decided that most of what has been planned could be done a better way, would the adviScry/steering committee be rece~tive to that?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to have the best plan possible.\r\n\r\nIS.\r\n\r\nWhat if parents want their children to be in career ievel I teachers\' classes? In the short run, the answer to this question is twofold. First, those teachers who are ~ being requested by parents will be in the first 1 or 2 groups. Second, parents will not know whether one teacher is less outstanding than another or whetherâˆ‘ one teacher has not yet had a chance to tty for career level I because of the luck of the draw. In the long run, there will probably be a residual core of teachers who will not qualify. However, with most merit pay systems, only about 10% are considered to be outstanding.\r\n\r\n16.\r\n\r\nCan a tenured teacher make career level I in one year? This is the intent, but it is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\n17.\r\n\r\nHow long will it take a tenured teacher to make career levels II and III? The committee has not discussed that, but for present teachers, the time will have to be collapsed.\r\n\r\n18.\r\n\r\nWhich program is taking priority--The Teacher Career Development Program or E. T.? The Teacher Career Development Program is an overarching system to which E. T. is related and can clearly be a part. E. T. will be received by all teachers by ,next fall regardless of their participation in the career development plan.\r\n\r\n19.\r\n\r\nWas attention given to alternative plans that have already been developed? The Merit Pay Committee did an extensive study. The fact is tha\'t CMS is far ahead of any o~her school system and people are looking to us for a plan âˆ‘\r\n\r\n,20.\r\n\r\nCould teachers who have after school duties (e.g., coaches) be included in this program? The intent is to include those who have other responsibilities after school.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n.-\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\nWhat happens to a teacher\'s pursuit of career status if he/she has to go on leave? âˆ‘ \' . Decisions and arrangements for continuation will have to b. aade (probably by the \'>advisory/steering c~mmittee) on an individual basis. I Will a master\'s degree be ~ requirement for career status? A master\'s degree will not be a requirement for present teachers. For new teachers, the goal is to have the training yield a master\'s degree, but the emphasis will be on training Tather than on a degree.\r\n\r\n,\r\nI\r\n\r\n22.\r\n\r\n-\'-.-------------\'-------------....--.,...\r\n4\r\n\r\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ .~~~....:.;..;.\'-:..:..-_-,_-__ __--_\'__.--~-_.-_ .... .. ... .âˆ‘ .. .. . ~_::...:. ........~_.:... . ~_~....\"\'__, . ____ ... _ -~\r\n\r\n._.~\r\n\r\n__:. . . :...:....:-::... :\'.....:.:a:~ . \",_._\"\"\".\"_.. \",\\_\"\",,-.--_,,,:, .âˆ‘....\r\n\r\n~~ -~.....\".;--..,..-~ .........\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n- .- .âˆ‘.. -.\r\n\r\n23.\r\n\r\nIa there aDytbiaa a teacher could do hefore settfns tenure that would help him/her the Ions run\' in There ia notbins a teacher could do to increase bis/her cbancea of being selected in an early sroup.

The exact role of the Consortium 1n regard to this p~ogram is not clear at this tille, but 1t 1a expected that it will play a vital role in negotiating with universities to provide graduate credit for the training which is developed.\r\n\r\n25.\r\n\r\nHow can we keep the granting of career level I status from becoming almost automatic like tenure? .

The individual professional review committee will know the context of the observer/evaluator reports and thia will give more meaning to them. 27. Will there be pressure from the achool aystem for all (preaent) teachers to achieve career level I atatus? Absolutely not. The in~ent of thb program is to aive ~eachers additional opportunities and rewards, not to compel them to achieve career I status. 28. If a teacher is changing fields, ahould he/she continue hia couraes? . This would have to be a peraonal decision, but continuation would probably be well advised. In the long run, those courses. might help the teacher meet the expectations stated for this program. 29. Bow would this program benefit a teacher with 25 years of experience? The answer to this question depends on the motivation of the teacher. However, there is no -.question that in terms of a~lary and career options, teachers nearing retirement have less to gain.\r\n30.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nIf a teacher can demonstrate he/ahe baa the atated competencies, can that teacher \"plug in\" at a higher level? Ivery teacher begins at Career level I. A teacher will not have to undergo training1nreaard to competencies for which he/sbe can dellonstrate outstanding performance. Bowever, this proaram 1nvolvea a aocialization proceas as well as a process of demonstrating technical akill. Therefore, there vill be some training in vhich every teacher in the proaram will be required to participate. In addition, teachers need to know as INch about evaluation aa those vho are evaluating them. Thua, training in evaluation vill be req~ired.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\'\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n__ ._\r\n\r\n:-:.::::::::===:7:._::-:::.o=.,-..-;-~.:.\'_~\'_\';_t.\"\"\':\';;\"\"\';; \'~ .... ___ ........- __ . ~ ... _..,_\'\\.. .. :o._\'~ ........._.\r\n\r\n\".-;\': âˆ‘âˆ‘. ;,._\".\r\n\r\ns\r\nWhat i, the fastest possible track for the first group,?

Yes. one representative from each school is requested to attend the area level chairpersons\' meetings and that representative mayor may not be the liaison chairperson.\r\n\r\n34.\r\n\r\nWon\'t career level 1 teachers take away many of the duties of the curriculum specialists? This would not happen in the short run but. in the long run. this program will have impact on most roles in the school system. It is important to keep in mind. however. that no one will have the rules changed on him/her.

However. such a person would not receive the state supplement for the G certificate.\r\n~7.\r\n\r\nWould principals tell parents who the career level 1 teachers are?

It was . decided that the advisory/steerinl committee would represent the dominant roles in the achool syatem. Why didn\'t this prolram begin with principals? . -This prolram did not begin with principals for several reasons. First. until expectationl are developed for teachers. it is nat known what should be expected of\" principals. Second. those personl who bave become principall have already taken advantage of salary and atatua rewards whicb are not available to teachers. Thus. if the program began witb principals, there would be an even greater difference than now exists between the career opportunities for teachers and the career opportunities for administrators. Third. unlesl teacbing ia made a more attractive occupation. there will be a teacher shortage in another decade. Such a shortage il not forseen among prinCipals.\r\n\r\n42.\r\n\r\n43.\r\n\r\nWill a scbool be looked down on if no one there is motivated enough to try? That would not happen in the short run.

No. This program i8 much more comprehensive than the Quality Assurance\r\nPro~ram.\r\n\r\nAbout Punding and Salary\r\n1.\r\n\r\nWhat are the sources of funding? The intent is to get new local money to fund this program. It is, \'believed that the proposed ...alary scale is both economically and politically feasible for local funding. G1~en the sentiment around tbe state and nation concerning quality education, it is possible that funding will also come from other sources.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nWhat is tbe effect of this program on tbe present local supplement?\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe intent is to keep tbe present supplement and any anticipated increases in tbat supplement for both preaent teachers and newly bired teachers.

No one will ever make less than that to which they are presently entitled on the current salary scale. Even more important, the salary scale is constructed in a way that assure that persons with a master\'s degree and substantial ~xperience will mnke more than teachers with a Ph. D. presently make.\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nWould a person with a master\'s degree make $1,000 more than the proposed salary?\r\n\r\nThe proposed salary scale is based on the assumption that one will have achieved a master\'s degree prior to achieving career status and teachers new to the system will be required to have a master\'s degree before they are granted career status. Teachers \'. presently in the system can achieve career status without gaining a master\'s degree. However, those who do not have a master\'s degree would not receive the state supplement for a G certificate.\r\n8.\' If a teacher does not perform well, would that teacher stay on a straight line on the salary scale?\r\n\r\nA person whose outstanding performance was not maintained would probably be given a year to remediate at the end of an evaluation cycle (i.e., at the end of a 3 year period for career level I teachers and at the end of a 5 year period for career level II and level III teachers). However, the teacher would not receive the expected $2,000 salary increase during that year, and if during that year performance did not move back to the level at which it had been previously, the teacher would probably be terminated. If the performance were brought back up during the remedia~ion year, the teacher would then receive the appropriate salary increase. 9. Will new teach~rs get the local supplement immediately upon employment or do they have to wait a certain number of years? The intention is that new teachers will get the local supplement beginning in their first year as they do now. 10. .\' 11. If 8 person 1s already at the top of the salary scale, where would that person enter the ne~ salary scale if he/she made career level I? That person would enter the new salary scale at the first point above where he/she is now. Will all teachers who make career level I make at least $2,000 more? No. Some teachers will make less than that.

Why 1a aelection based on reputation? Ian\'t thia a popularity contest?\r\n\r\nSelection is based on reputation so that 1Â£ the evaluation process determines aomeone to be outstanding. that evaluation vill be believed. One of the worst things that could happen to this program is for a teacher to be granted career level I status and other teachers (or administrators) or parents say. \"If that\'s what they mean by career level 1. 1 don\'t want any part of 1t.\" The issue of the popularity contc:st will be resolved by asking an applicant\'. colleaguea if they believe the reputation to be deserved. It ia important to keep 1n mind that. all preaent teachers will have an opportunity (1f they want 1t) to try for career level I. The question of reputation ia asked only to determine who will be given the first opportunity. 2. Why ahould the teacher membera of the advi.ory/ateering committee be paid and given apecial consideration? They are being paid and given special considerat-ion because they do a lot of work (e.g âˆ‘âˆ‘ speaking to faculty groups. receiving phone calls at home from teachers who have questions about the proposed program) after the regular school day has ended. In addition. to avoid a conflict of interests. they are the only teachers in the school system who are being asked not to apply _to be in the first group. (Eventually, all teachers on the steering committee will be required to have career level I status.)\r\n3.\r\n\r\nWhy does experience count? Experience counts because the school system believes it has aâˆ‘ \'commitment to teachers who bave provided long term service. and experienced teachers have less time to benefit f~om the proposed program.\r\n\r\n4. Why is it that only experience 1n CMS counta in the selection in process?\r\nA final decision on whether all experience or only CMS experience will count 1n the selection proceas has not yet been made. The advisory/steering committee would like to have feedback from teachers on thia 1asue. All experience.!!!! count in regard to salary level.\r\nâˆ‘ I\r\n,\r\n\r\n:\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nWhat happens to people who come from other school systems?

No. The committee decided to stay away from personnel files because, for this purpose, the usefulness of the information cannot be guaranteed. Past performance is difficult to verify.\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nWho will receive the questionnaire? All of the teachers and administrators an applicant believes are knowledgeable will have an opportunity to respond, but in order to assure that someone does not \"stack the deck,\" other teachers and administrators a teacher has been known to have worked with also will be asked to respond.\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nWill the questionnaire be used toâˆ‘determine career level I status? No. Data from the questionnaires will only be used to determine when an applicant will have the opportunity to try for career level I status.\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\nWill teachers know in which group they will be? Yes. Teachers will be told in the spring of 1984 in which group they will be.\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\nCould the category for 11-24 years of experience be broken into smaller categories? That decision will have to be made after it is known who applies. However, if it has to be adjusted, teachers would be informed of what the committee is .doing in this regard and feedback would be solicited. Nothing would be changed without letting teachers know âˆ‘. .\r\n\'\r\n\r\n\'0\"\r\n\r\n13.\r\n\r\nWill parents and students be involved in the selection process? No. It is not the intent of the committee to involve parents and students in the , selection process but rather to ask other teachers and administrators about an applicant\'s reputation with parents and students.\r\n\r\n14. If a lot of people apply, how will the paper work be handled?\r\nThere will not be much \"paper work,\" but it will handled by cOilputers. 15. Is there a penalty for applying late? Persons who apply in the first group will be assigned a year of entry. Persons who apply later would necessarily be admitted only after the first applicants had had the opportunity to participate.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n---------.......~.-------------,,~_.\r\n\r\n___ - .... -\r\n\r\n__ .. __ 0\"_. .âˆ‘âˆ‘..\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nl6.\r\n\r\nWill .ex be taken iDto account iD the ~election proce âˆ‘âˆ‘ ?

Why are expectations\r\n80\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nvague?\r\n\r\nThe expectations (perhaps, better called goals) specify tbe broad areas in which evaluation will occur. They are not more specific because they are not criteria for evaluation. 2. How can the expectations be measured? They cannot be measured, but whether one has the knowledge and skills which make it likely that one can meet the expectations can be evaluated, and whether one performs in the classroom in ways indicated by the expectations can be evaluated. For example. one of the expectations is that the teacher will have knowledge of his/her subject area. Whether one has this competency can be observed and evaluated in a number of ways. It could be evaluated by an examination of the teacher\'s lessonâˆ‘ plans, by listening to the teacher\'s lectures, and by examining the effectiveness of the teacher\'s participation in training experiences relevant to the content area. 3. Why is there so much emphasis on performance outside the classroom? As indicated above (see general questions), the emphasis is and always has been on outstanding performance in the classroom. However, there are things a teacher can do (e.g., actively participate with other faculty members in solving school problems, taking leadership roles on faculty and school system c01ll1l11ttees) which go beyond the four walls of the classroom, but which have a direct impact on the quality of instruction that is delivered inside the classroom. The goal of this program is to spread the impact of an outstanding teacher around the school and around the scbool system. 4. How can I meet the expectations if my principal won\'t let me? You can\'t. However. principals will be expected to be supportive of the Teacher Career Development Program. Training will be provided to them and the evaluation of each prinCipal will take into account his/ber work in support of this program. In addition, given the structure of the individual professional review committee. the teacher will have a support system whether or not the principal is actively supportive âˆ‘\r\n.. 5.\r\n\r\nHow can a teacher have all the extra responsibilities and still maintain quality instruction in the classroom?\r\n!~\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is twofold. First, each teacher does not have to meet every expectation every day or even every year. Different expectations will be emphasized in different years depending upon one\'s particular school and job a.signment. Second. if every teacher is expected to share the responsibilities which outstanding teachers now assume (and they will be expected to do this), outstanding teachers will have more time âˆ‘ . 6~ . Why hasn\'t a\r\n\r\nJOb description been developed for teachers?\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed by the advisory/steering committee that the list of expectations for teachers is, in effect, the job description for teachers.\r\n\r\nâˆ‘.. -._ ...\r\n\r\n_.-------_._-----------_ ...\r\n\r\n__\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n_--_ ... _- ---.- --- - _._.-..\r\n....\r\n\r\n,\r\n\r\n--, ...,._--_.- ..âˆ‘.. \'-._-\r\n\r\n...âˆ‘\r\n\r\n-.-\r\n\r\n12\r\nquestions About Training\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nWhat are the training requirements and who will pay for the training? The training requirements have not been formally ideiitiUed, but they will include the.knowledge and skills that will enable a teacher to\'be likely to meet the expectations for career level I. The training will be roughly equivalent to a one week summer workshop and two three-hour course~. However, the training should not be ~hought of as traditional college courses. a.ther, the training will be job-embedded and work-related. It will occur both duri~g school and after school. It will involve observations, demonstrations and the building of collegial relationships. There will be a core training experience for all candidates whi.ch will include such components as training in the observation and evaluation processes and instruction in the history and values of the school system. There will be other training experiences designed to meet the needs of small groups and individuals as these needs are related to the expectations for career level I. All of the training experiences will be provided by the school system.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nWhat is the relationship between E. T. and other training programs (e.g., Consortium programs) and the proposed program? Since the training for the Career Development Program will be competency-based, any training experiences which enable a teacher to meet the stated expectations will be to that teacher\'s advantage. The fact that a present teacher has participated in any given program will have no effect on whether that teacher is selected first for this program. By the time this program goes into effect, all teacherR in CMS will have undergone E. T. training.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nWill advanced degrees count? A degree, itself, will not count. However, 1Â£ the training which led to the degree better enables. the teacher to meet the stated expectations, that training will, of course, be to that teacher\'s advantage.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nHow would this program affect people already in a master\'s program? A teacher could not effectively participate in this program and\', a master\'s program at the same time. However, depending upon a number of factors (e.g., one\'s area of concentration, the university at which the master\'s work is being done, etc.), the Career Development Program training might fit into a master\'s program.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nIs the requirement for summer training a must? Yes.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nWill a teacher\'s transcript be taken into account in determining the training he/she Deeds? No. Claa.room performance is what will be taken intoaccoUDt.\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nAfter a teacher arrives at career level I, does he/she have to go through training every three years? As a professional, teachers are expected to keep abreast of their field and new developments in it. Sometimes this involves formal training, sometimes confe,ences. There is no \"renewal credit\" requirement for career development, but certificate renewal requirements will stay in place. .\r\nI\r\n\r\n..... ,=\r\n\r\nâˆ‘\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n.....âˆ‘...... ........--___ --.._ _ _ _ _ _ ..... _ _ _ _ _ _ r\r\n\r\n~_\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\n-._.~.,.\r\n\r\n............... .........\r\n~\r\n\r\n\"~\r\n\r\nId\r\n\r\n13\r\n.8. Won\'t there have to be training for\r\npri~cipals?\r\n\r\nYes. Administrators and specialists will need special training\'which will enable them to be supportive of the Teacher Career Development Program. 9. If s teacher transfers to another school during the training period, what effect will this have? School transfers will have no effect on the training. 10. How often will training programs begin? Training programs will begin every year. 11. If a teacher already has a master\'s degree, will a higher degree be provided through theâˆ‘training? No. a higher degree will not be provided. However, a teacher on hb /her own might be able to negotiate with the university involved to have the training count as part of his/her graduate program. 12. If it happens that the training occurs through the Consortium, would the Consortium certificate be just as good as a regular certificate? There is no such thing as a Consortium certificate. The certificates all come from the state. The Consortium recommends a candidate for a certificate just as a university does. 13. What will happen if eMS gets all this planning done for the training and universities don\'t cooperate. There is every indication that universities will cooperate. They have been very cooperative with Consortium programs. In the long run, it is in the interest of the university to cooperate because this program will generate business for them. However, if the universities do not SUppoTt this program we would continue it. 14. Why doesn\'t the new program \"hold off\" on training until there is enough money to accommodate all teachers who want to be trained? It is imperative to the integrity of the program that quality control be maintained. Technically and logistically it would be impossible to maintain quality, control with large numbers of people. 15. If no one \"washes out,\" won\'t this reflect poo,rly on the training program? Given the high standards it is likely some will fail to meet them. 16. Could teachers who teach in summer school be in the training program 1Â£ they were selected? .---.------Yes. 17. The training will be scheduled so as not to interfere with summer school.\r\n,\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\'\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nWill the summer training be for all groups or just the first one? In the long run, the training now planned for the summer might take place at some other time.

Furthermore. it is intended that those teachers who achieve career level I status be persons whose teaching performance is exemplary and could serve as a model for others to emulate. Given this goal and these intentions. the selection of existing teachers will b~ conducted in two phases. To be eligible to be selected for Phase I (1984-85 and 1985-86). applicants must meet the following conditions: 1. The applicant must provide direct delivery of instruction to students on a regularly assigned basis. This includes regular classroom teachers. special education teachers. media specialists in the elementary schools. student services specialists in the elementary schools and homebound teachers. The professional staff who are not included above. will be able to apply for groups selected for the 1986-87 school year and subsequently. The applicant must agree that. if requested to do so. he/she would be willing to serve for a designated period of time as a mentor for a new teacher or as a member of an advisory/assessment team for an experienced teacher even if he/she is precluded from acceptance into the first two groups. Given the results of a peer/administrator nomination process described below. there must be clear and convincing evidence that the applicant is regarded by his/her peers and administrators as an individual who is among the most outstanding teachers in the school in which he/she teachers.

For example. if the number of --âˆ‘âˆ‘--------eHgible-faeul-ty-is-l00.-an-indiv1dual respondent could identify up to 25 persons.

For the 1985-86 school year, as many additional people will be selected for entry into the program as it is determined can be provided with high quality training and evaluation. All persons who were in the pool described above who were not selected for Phase I {1984-85, 1985-86) will have their names placed in the applicant pool for Phase II. (It is recognized that given the limitation in the number of persons who can be selected in Phase 1, there will be many outstanding teachers who will not be selected in this phase. This is unfortunate, but as has been discussed numerous times, limiting the size of the initial groups is essential to assuring the integrity of the program.)\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nSelection Procedures: Phase II Subsequent to the selection of Phase I candidates, all remaining applicants will be selected on a random basis and assigned an entry year based on a best .estimate of the school system\'s capacity to provide high quality training and evaluation and on the number of applicants remaining in the pool.\r\no\r\n\r\nWho May Apply? Any teacher level employee of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System who has or will have tenure by September, 1984 and who is willing to undergo the training and evaluation may apply. Those who indicate their interest in being selected for Phase 1 must also be willing to meet and accept the special conditions that apply to the selection of Phase I candidates (i.e., they must provide direct delivery of instruction to students on a regularly assigned basis and they must agree to serve as a mentor or as an advisory/assessment team member if requested to do so.) ...\r\n\r\n.-\r\n\r\n---~------,\r\n\r\n\'.\r\n\r\n.-\r\n\r\n.... \'--\r\n\r\n-=-===::=:.:::::::.:::::=:.::..--;-:.:.;-\":.:. ;.-.:.::;\' ._--- - _ _. -__ .. - - - .... - . - - \".-\"\'-- .............. :\' - .... ... ..\r\nto âˆ‘ \" âˆ‘ __ âˆ‘âˆ‘âˆ‘ \" âˆ‘âˆ‘ ___ \"\r\n\r\n~\"\"---\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n-_\r\n\r\n.. ..\r\n\r\nOBSERVER/EVALUATORS Job Description Persons selected to serve in the capacity of observer/evaluators will be expected to engage in systematic observations and evaluations of teachers.

The ideas presented are tailored to specific needs of the Toledo district. Much of what we have presented here represents our own thinking and creation.\r\n\r\nFifteen states now have state-wide career ladders or pilot projects; another fourteen have established mechanisms for developing such programs, including Ohio. None of the ladders in place are working satisfactorily, and those in Florida, Tennessee and Alabama are in serious trouble because of strenuous opposition from teachers. Each of these three states is currently involved in difficult \"re-tooling\" phases in an effort to save their career ladder concepts.\r\n\r\nPoorly planned career ladders seem to be standard features of existing programs.\r\n\r\nThe necessity to develop career options is real, however.\r\n\r\nForty to fifty percent of America\'s teachers will retire or leave teaching in the next seven to ten years. These are conservative estimates and although Toledo\'s demographic data does not fall into the national pattern, shortages in math and science are already evident. The number of individuals needed to staff American schools will require colleges to more than double the number of students who currently choose teacher education as a career. In 1981,\r\n\r\n1,400 science and math teachers were awarded B.A. degrees. There are over 15,000 school districts in the United States. During the 1982-83 school Nationally, only year, 18,000 science and math teachers stopped teaching.\r\n\r\nEight percent of the teaching force has four years experience or less.\r\n\r\nMoney alone will not entice talented young people to the classroom, although leading researchers of the problem, such as Rand, the Carnegie Foundation, the Holmes group, and almost all individual researchers, agree it is imperative that teacher pay be brought into line with professions competing for talented men, women, and minorities. What is also clear in all the research is that teaching must be professionalized to make the job . appealing. Opportunity for professional growth and added responsibilities must be made available to teachers in order to attract and hold good teachers. While there are various suggestions about what schools should look like in the future, a change in the role of the teacher is the key to professionalization; and professionalization and pay are the keys to\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nmaintaining public schools acceptable to the public and adequate for national needs in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe Carnegie Task Force Report, \"A Nation Prepared: Teachers For the 21st Century,\" calls for reforms that seek full professionalization of teaching and the restructuring of schools. Opportunities for professional development, control of instructional responsibilities, and greater compensation are at the heart of Carnegie1s vision for the profession. Carnegie recommendations that mesh with concepts Toledo has created for its career development plan include:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nTeachers need to be given discretion and autonomy that invariably\"mark . professional status.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nMost teachers need to be provided with support so they can be more effective and productive.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nNew approaches to school leadership need to be tried, especially those that put teachers at the center of the instructional program.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nDistricts should foster collegial styles of decision-making with \"Lead Teachers\" playing a central role.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nThe range of teachers I salaries should be increased to those of other professions with comparable education, training, and experience.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nMost of these Carnegie recommendations were unknown to us when we developed the basic concepts of the Toledo Career Development Plan. It is apparent,\r\n\r\nhowever, that the two designs have common assumptions and many similar designs.\r\n\r\nThe Toledo design is based on a professionalization reform already in place - the intern/intervention programs with their heavy emphasis on peer review. tors. Peer review has been accepted by Toledo teachers and administraIt is an example of a teacher-management shared governance responsibility (inducting quality new teachers to the district and removing tenured teachers identified and proven to be unqualified), normally not found in public schools. Our career option plan relies on peer review to identify excellent teachers who would then have opportunities to share responsibility for developing, and implementing educational plans for the district. The identification of talent and the opportunity to use that talent to address district needs is central to the concepts that follow. We think this proposal is a logical next step in our efforts to build a profession for teachers in Toledo. Ideas developed by Carnegie or the Holmes Group will help us shape and refine our local efforts in the future. Some of our design might be useful to various national and state planning efforts currently under way.\r\n\r\nThe design that follows assumes continuation of the traditional salary schedule as per the contractual commitment that exists. (See page 98 of the agreement between the Toledo Federation of Teachers and the Toledo Board of Education.) Voluntary usage of the Career Options and Professional Development Plan is intended to encourage excellent teaching by all\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nStaff members; discover and utilize talents in ways not now possible; answer critics who rightly point out that teaching is an occupation absent .significant psychic and monetary rewards; and avoid the severe resistance American teachers have shown to mandatory \"career ladders\" or merit pay schemes. Our priority was not to save the single salary schedule; rather, it was to create a voluntary career ladder based on incentives.\r\n\r\n*A word of caution: We are not naive about the difficulty of gaining acceptance and support for this reform. The various audiences in the district We expect will be confronted with new procedures that are non-traditional. and welcome comments, suggestions and ideas.\r\n\r\nThe need to maintain public confidence in public education demands a thoughtful planning now or Toledo\'s carefully trained corps of new teachers will face the same frustrations of every other generation of American teachers.\r\n\r\nTHE TOLEDO CAREER OPTION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN OUTLINE\r\n\r\nThe Toledo Career Development Plan will consist of four levels of achievement constituting a single career option and development track. All teachers who qualify through an induction process will enter the program and will be given the opportunity to progress through the four levels by meeting the established minimum requirements. These levels will be designated as Commendation level, Green level, Blue level and Red level.\r\n\r\nEach applicant to the plan will earn a \"ranking score\" based on an interview, references, a written submission, a test, and peer observations.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThose applicants at or above a predetermined cut-off score will be placed on the Commendation level for one year.\r\n\r\nDuring the initial commendation year, the candidates will attempt to qualify for the next, or Green, level. This advancement will be determined by intensive peer review, plus a- project assigned by a governing board. The three higher levels require proscribed educational requirements and various duties assigned by the governing board in addition to intensive peer review at the Green level. The details of these requirements and the\r\n\r\nroles of the various groups and individuals are explained in detail later in this document.\r\n\r\nOUTLI NE OF PLAN LEVEL\r\nQualification (Induction)\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\nAchieve a ranking score at or above the cut-off score.\r\n\r\nCommendation - first year\r\n\r\nB.A. degree, four-year provisional certification, successful completion of the peer review procedure and assigned project.\r\n\r\nGreen\r\n\r\nB.A. degree, four-year provisional certification, successful completion of peer review and assigned duties.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nBlue\r\n\r\nM.A. degree, successful completion of a number of assigned duties each with a unit value.\r\n\r\nRed\r\n\r\nM.A.-in-field or twenty post-graduate hours related to the track activities, successful completion of assigned duties\r\n\r\nAll projects and duties will be assigned or approved by the board of governors.\r\n\r\nTOLEDO CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF TEACHING\r\nWe expect the career development plan, at least in its initial years, to attract more candidates than can be, or perhaps should be, processed. In order to insure fairness and objectivity in the induction phase, a point system will be used for ranking applicants for acceptance into the induction year. The points earned would establish the order of candidate acceptance into the program.\r\n\r\nThe ranking system is based on a maximum total of one hundred points distributed over five areas: observation, reference, interview, testing, and writing. (The induction year relies heavily on peer review of outstanding teaching performance and is discussed later.)\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nPoints Test 15 Written 15 Reference 15 Interview 15 Observation 40\r\n\r\nReferences (15) A total of five references will be required, one each from the principal or supervisor, the building representative, and a teacher at the work site. The other two references will be chosen by the committee from a list of five to seven names of individuals who have knowledge of the candidate\'s professional competence submitted by the applicant. These references may come from any source that the applicant chooses.\r\n\r\nThe reference criteria will follow closely those used by applicants to the intern program. However, the form will be set up so each response desired falls under the general heading of \"average\", \"below average\", and \"outstanding.\" Each of these three headings will have five marks that will\r\n\r\nhave to be circled by the respondent.\r\n\r\nFor example: Below Average\r\n/ / / / /\r\n\r\nAverage\r\n/ / / / /\r\n\r\nOutstanding\r\n/ / / / /\r\n\r\nA numerical average can be obtained based on the assumption that fifteen is possible for each response and for the maximum obtainable for this portion of the ranking. A place on the form will be provided for comments.\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nA final question will be asked the respondent:\r\n\r\n\"How many points out of a total of fifteen would you assign this candidate?1I _____\r\n\r\nA reference committee of three persons will assign the actual point value based on all the information provided. (The reference committee will play no other part in the ranking process.) Each committee member will rank a candidate independently and a final average will be determined.\r\n\r\nThe references will be held in confidence and will not be used for other purposes.\r\n\r\nWritten Submission (15) Each candidate will submit a written statement answering such questions as: \"Which\' activity in the career\'option plan areyou best qualified for and why?\" or \"What will you contribute as a participant in the career option plan?\" A reading committee of peers will independently assign up to fifteen points and an average score will be tallied. The reading committee will perform no other task in the ranking process. All applicants will write their submission at the same time under the direction of the reading committee. This will be a three-person committee, one of whom will be a composition teacher, and one of whom will be familiar with the career plan.\r\n\r\nThis written submission would give the applicant the opportunity to identify areas in the plan in which he or she is interested. tion would be subject to approval by the governing (Final determinaThe reading committee)\r\n\r\ncommittee will determine the criteria on which the written submissions will\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nbe judged prior to their evaluations.\r\n\r\nA copy of the criteria will be submitted to the board of governors for approval.\r\n\r\nInterview (15) The interview committee will be composed of three persons: one administrator, one teacher, and one university person, subject to approval by the governing committee. Each will independently assign up to fifteen points\r\n\r\nand then the scores will be averaged for final assignment of points. Again, no other ranking task will be performed by this committee.\r\n\r\nEach applicant will be asked similar questions including whether a five-year commitment could be made to classroom teaching.\r\n\r\nTest (15) The Miller Analogy Test will be given to all applicants.\r\n\r\nThe test scores can be broken down into segmented values which represent one to fifteen points for our purposes. Applicants will take the tests as a group. If other appropriate tests become available the governing board is empowered to supplement or replace the Miller Analogy Test.\r\n\r\nObservations (40) Peer review observation of classroom performance is assigned the highest point value because it most directly relates to the induction year. The . Toledo Career Options and Professional Development Plan proposal rests heavily on outstanding teaching. The concept not only affords teachers new opportunities, it encourages outstanding performance from others since\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nparticipation will be voluntary as has already been agreed in the current teacher contract.\r\n\r\nEach candidate will be observed a total of three times, once each by three different consulting teachers from the intern program. A list of five consultants will be submitted to the candidate from which they will select three. Each observation will be announced in advance so that the candidate (Unan-\r\n\r\ncan be prepared to demonstrate his or her best performance level.\r\n\r\nnounced visits will take place during the Commendation year.) Our feeling is that an average performance, after a visit is announced, should be prominently reflected in the ranking process for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nEach observer will independently assign up to forty points based on the standards and criteria used in the intern program. Scores will be averaged for final point assignment. ranking procedure. Observers will not be used in any other\r\n\r\nNo candidate can be accepted for the induction year An appropriate\r\n\r\nunless an observation score of at least thirty is achieved.\r\n\r\nwaiting period, to be determined by the governing committee, will be necessary before reapplication can be considered.\r\n\r\n*These observations can be done as part of the intern consultant\'s work assignment. We have enough consultants to do both. Inactive consultants\r\n\r\nalso could be used if needed.\r\n\r\nThe cost of this portion of the ranking\r\n\r\nprocess, while greater than the other four, will not be prohibitive.\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nA cut-off score will be assigned for induction. Those who score below the final cut-off number could reapply after an appropriate waiting period determined by the board of governors. They need only requalify in those areas where deficiencies were noted. An explanation of the reapplication\r\n\r\nprocess will be included for those who fall below the cut-off score.\r\n\r\nThe cut-off score will be determined and published by the executive committee of the governing board before individual applicant scores are known. All candidates at or above the cut-off score will be deemed a \"commended teacher\" and be\r\nelig~ble\r\n\r\nto participate in the qualification process for\r\n\r\n\"Green level\" status.\r\n\r\nIf candidates so choose, they may remain at the In doing so they forfeit\r\n\r\nCommendation level if the requirements are met.\r\n\r\ntheir right for graduation to the \"Green level\" for a waiting period to be determined by the governing board.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to protest point assignments will do so through a written application to the program\'s board of governors.\r\n\r\nGeneral Information on Ranking and Application The ranking system is crucial during the initial enrollment for the program. In later years, applications can be expected to level off somewhat,\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nbut that level is difficult to predict.\r\n\r\nIt is not absolutely necessary to Di$trict needs,\r\n\r\nopen enrollment every year, but it could be done annually.\r\n\r\nteacher demand, and financial allocations are the three factors that will influence how often the induction year is activated. Applications and induction, in other words, could be timed differently.\r\n\r\nTeachers who have completed five years in the Toledo system will be eligible to apply. A four-year provisional certificate will be required as a\r\n\r\nminimum certification status. There will be no further degree requirement for induction.\r\n\r\nTime Line The start-up of the program is dependent upon two conditions. First, a\r\n\r\nsource must be found, outside of local funds, to adequately fund the program. Second, the program must receive the approval of the membership (See \"Nego-\r\n\r\nof the TFT and the superintendent and board of education. tiations\" below.)\r\n\r\nGOVERNING BOARD\r\n\r\nWe envision a twelve-member governing board for the program constituted as follows:\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nsix teachers appointed by\" the Federation (most will be from outside the ranks of consulting teachers)\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nthree administrators at the executive director level or above appointed by the superintendent\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\ntwo college persons, one from Bowling Green State University, one from the University of Toledo who will be selected from a list of candidates submitted by the universities and serve as non-voting ad hoc members for terms of two years\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nthe committee will be chaired by a non-voting member selected by a majority vote of the governing board\r\n\r\nSeven votes will be needed to reject a recommendation. ments will be for specific three-year terms.\r\n\r\nTeacher appoint-\r\n\r\n(These could be staggered at\r\n\r\nthe start.) The Federation board of directors and building representatives will confirm the appointee upon recommendation of the president.\r\n\r\nThe governing board will exercise overall guidance and control of the program and make certain recommendations to an executive committee. The\r\n\r\nboard will hear appeals and accept or reject induction year recommendations for individuals aspiring to placement in the advanced career option levels and to the initial commendation level. Budgetary matters will be decided\r\n\r\nby the executive committee although budget recommendations could be made by the governing board.\r\n\r\nThe executive committee will be composed of the president of the Federation, the superintendent, one teacher, and one administrator. With the\r\n\r\npossible exception of the superintendent, the other three members will be governing board members. Budget allocations ultimately will rest with the\r\n\r\nschool board, although a unanimous executive board recommendation will carry obvious weight.\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nDirector It will be necessary to assign one person to work for the governing board to coordinate the work of the various induction committees and other activities of the board and the program. We anticipate an intensive campaign to gain initial approval of the concept by the teaching staff. Experience of others indicates that a continuous flow of accurate information is vital even after initial support has been achieved. The key individuals on the executive committee will not have the time necessary to insure a smooth implementation of the program.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that there will be enough work for this individual to be employed full-time. Initial staff acceptance efforts and managing the Coordination of work\r\n\r\nfirst induction year will be considerable tasks.\r\n\r\nassignments with district needs is another obvious task that will be ongoing. ence. Other answers about the futu\'re can only be gained through experi-\r\n\r\nSecretarial help is planned on a part-time or shared basis the first year.\r\n\r\nNegotiations Ideally, career ladder plans need to be funded, wholly, or in large part, at the state level through line item allocations as is the case with special education or vocational units. Any local career option expendi-\r\n\r\nture should be viewed as an additional cost to the district. The Federation will continue to pursue regular salary schedule funding in negotiations. Without outside funding, the plan would risk loss of teacher Locally\r\n\r\nsupport in subsequent years through the negotiations process. funded career ladders are risky at best.\r\n15\r\n\r\nProperly funded, negotiations at\r\n\r\ncontract expiration periods will see few, if any, demands in the career option area by either management or the union. Essentially, state funding\r\n\r\nwill allow us to proceed with our own \"educational policy trust agreement,\" a concept advocated by Dr. Charles Kershner in California.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMENDATION YEAR\r\n\r\nCommendation Teachers After the induction process, all teachers at or above the cut-off score will be placed on the \"Commendation level\" for one year.\r\n\r\nDuring this year commendation teachers must choose one of three options\r\n\r\nThe first is to initiate an attempt to qualify for the Green level. second is to attempt to meet the qualifications for remaining at the Commendation level. The third is to do nothing which will result in\r\n\r\nThe expiration of the commendation status.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue at the Commendation level, or qualify for higher track levels, a candidate will be observed for a number of hours determined by the board of governors. (Probably six observations by three different\r\n\r\npeers for a total of eighteen.) These observations will be done by three consultants and their summary report will be submitted to the board of governors using the same procedure as that used at the Green level. Candi dates who are deemed lI ou tstanding\" by the board of governors wi 11 be awarded continuing \"commendation ll status, and will be subject to a periodic review of their status as determined by the board of governors. Those who\r\n\r\nare not deemed lI outstanding\" in the initial commendation year will be\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\ndenied any placement on the career ladder and reapplication will be precluded for a period of time determined by the board of governors. Candi-\r\n\r\ndates who choose to continue at the commendation level may make future application for Green status after a period of time determined by the board of governors.\r\n\r\nCommendation Year Performance The commendation year qualification is based on two factors: performance in the classroom and production of a project assigned by the board of governors. The project will be more limited in scope than the tasks expected to The commendation teacher may apply\r\n\r\nqualify for the three higher levels.\r\n\r\nfor placement at the next level by initiating a written request to the board of governors using a form provided.\r\n\r\nObservation-Peer Review Three teacher consultants will be used to insure greater accuracy in the peer review process. will not. Some observations will be announced in advance; some\r\n\r\nThe criteria for teacher performance currently in existence for Teacher consultants will be\r\n\r\nthe intern-intervention programs will be used. looking for \"outstanding\" performance.\r\n\r\nA prose statement at the completion of the observations will be written. The consultant will state his or her judgment about outstanding performance with supporting reasons. The evaluation statement will be called the \"summary.\" Each consultant will work independently; one the first quarter,\r\n\r\none the second, and one the third.\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nObservations will not be made on test days or other times when a regular lesson is not being taught.\r\n\r\nProject For Commendation Teachers The governing board itself will be responsible for the project evaluation completed during the first three quarters. This can be done by sub-committees of three governors or by a specially constituted committee. Project rating will take place prior to summary presentations of the classroom observations. The final decision of the board of governors will be influenced by the project as well as the performance summaries.\r\n\r\nSummary Process For Commendation Teachers At the end of the third quarter of the school year, the governing board will meet to hear one of the three teacher consultants present all three summaries. All three will be in attendance and subject to questioning by the board. The governing board will pass on all recommendations. If there\r\n\r\nshould be a variance among the summaries, i.e., two outstanding, one average, the board will decide acceptance or rejection. Consultants can\r\n\r\ncome in with an agreed recommendation when possible. An agreed-recommendation might be possible even in some cases where one summary differed from the other two.\r\n\r\nThe commendation teacher will not know the summary results until after the third quarter. Copies of the summaries, minus the consultant\'s name, will\r\n\r\nbe provided at that time. The individual will be afforded an opportunity to comment to the board if dissatisfied with any or all summaries.\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nConsultant presentations will follow such an appearance. not be used in any other management process.\r\n\r\nSummaries will\r\n\r\nAssignment-Rejection The board of governors will assign those commendation teachers who successfully complete the peer review and project requirements to the \"Green level\" of the track. Green level status will become effective-at the\r\n\r\nconclusion of commendation level school year.\r\n\r\nCandidates who are deemed \"outstanding\" in their teaching but do not gain approval of their project will remain on the Commendation level.\r\n(\r\n\r\nThe board\r\n\r\nof governors may choose to assign a second project; however, if it too is found unacceptable the assignment to Commendation level will be made.\r\n\r\nThose candidates not deemed \"outstanding\" in their teaching performance will be denied further designation as a commendation teacher. Reapplica-\r\n\r\ntion to the program will be precluded for a period of time to be determined by the board of governors.\r\n\r\nAssignment of Consultants Observation assignments will be made by the governing board or its executive committee. Senior consultants, those who have completed three years\r\n\r\nin the intern program, will be used for the peer review process, as well as some current consultants if needed. Each consultant will have an assigned\r\n\r\nnumber of observations to make each quarter for each candidate. A consultant will be assigned a number of candidates as determined by the board of\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\ngovernors.\r\n\r\nDuring the induction process and commendation year this should\r\n\r\nbe the senior consultant\'s only job.\r\n\r\nTRACK MECHANICS \'\r\n\r\nAfter the commendation year and Green level status, successive levels are achieved through educational requirements and various project or work assignments. These projects will be assigned varying unit values so that\r\n\r\nadvancement to Blue and Red levels will be earned.\r\n\r\nTime Requirements Three academic years will have to be completed before a Green level teacher can move to Blue. The same\r\n~hree\r\n\r\nyear requirement will apply to Red level\r\n\r\nstatus, so that the earliest a Green level person can achieve Red level status would be six academic years in the track. have to qualify for Blue level within six years. Green level teachers will Those who do not qualify\r\n\r\nfor the Blue level within the allotted time will be placed back at the Commendation level. Reapplication to the upper levels would be at the\r\n\r\ndiscretion of the governing board. There will be no time requirement limitation for movement from Blue level to Red level.\r\n\r\nDegrees A bachelor\'s degree will qualify one for the Green level. A master\'s\r\n\r\ndegree will be required for Blue level. The degree can be in any field or area of professional interest. However, before Red level is achieved, Blue\r\n\r\nlevel teachers will have to show at least twenty graduate hours, during or post M.A., related to his/her track activities. A master\'s degree in the\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nRed level teacher\'s teaching field can be used in lieu of the above requirement, however.\r\n\r\nUnits Units will be assigned to projects or work by the board of governors. Each\r\n\r\nGreen level or Blue level teacher will have to earn an appropriate number of units each year to remain in the program. Governors can decide when Career option teachers\r\n\r\nsomeone has failed to earn a particular unit, etc.\r\n\r\nwill be expected to accept assignments made by the board of governors.\r\n\r\nThe status of individuals whose work is inadequate once higher ladder levels have been achieved will be subject to review by the board of governors. Peer review and/or a change in ladder level placement may result if\r\n\r\n\"thought necessary by the board of governors, although an effort will be made to match individual strengths and desires with district needs.\r\n\r\nTrack Movement Intent to move from one level to the next will be self-initiated. The\r\n\r\nboard of governors will be notified that the required units have been achieved and the next level will be designated at the conclusion of an academic year.\r\n\r\nSince it is required that Green level teachers achieve Blue level within six years, there will be a demand for activities to accumulate units. The\r\n\r\nboard of governors will assure that assignments will be distributed fairly, while placing people in assignments for which they are best suited. This\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nshould not be an insurmountable problem, but one that can lead to dissatisfaction if left to chance.\r\n\r\nBlue level teachers will not have to qualify for Red level status within a given time period. Tasks assigned by the board of governors will have to be accepted though.\r\n\r\nRecognition So that achievement is given appropriate recognition, each teacher at each level of the career development plan will be awarded a ribbon similar to the campaign ribbons used by the military. An award ceremony will be held and wi 11 be open to a11 teachers. The ri bbon wi 11 denote wh i châˆ‘âˆ‘ âˆ‘levelâˆ‘âˆ‘haâˆ‘s\r\n\r\nbeen attained. We see the \"ribbon\" as a small bar-shaped \"decoration\" that can be worn if the teacher chooses to do so. This visible sign of achieve-\r\n\r\nment is important to the incentive concept of the program.\r\n\r\nTime Line If funding is achieved, we can be ready for the induction year by September, 1987. The Commendation year would commence September, 1988.\r\n\r\nTRACK ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS\r\n\r\nActivities or projects assigned to career option teachers will be clustered under five general designations: Professional Development, Curriculum, Community Leadership, Educational Technology, and Performance. activities will fall into more than one cluster. Many of the\r\n\r\nUnit values will be\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nassigned based on such factors as length of service, difficulty, value to the district, and amount of work required.\r\n\r\nClustering activities and limiting the career option program to one track should give us the advantages of flexibility and simplicity. Teachers can easily understand the concept of a single track and how one qualifies. Clustering provides general direction to career teachers and to the board of governors and avoids undesirable restrictions in the assignment process.\r\n\r\nThe following list of track activities is exemplary, not exhaustive.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\nboard of governors will develop a process for suggesting additional activities. That process will be open to as wide an audience as possible.\r\n\r\nSome tasks in the first level of the track, as determined by the board of governors, could be assigned to those teachers who have chosen permanent commendation status.\r\n\r\nProfessional Development\r\n\r\n* * * * * *\r\n\r\nIdentify and videotape standards and examples of effective teaching practice Conduct inservice training for undergraduate teacher education students Attend professional conferences and conventions Involvement in applications or procurement of educational grants Presentations to undergraduate and graduate classes Design P.G.C. courses Research\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWrite papers for publication and/or presentation (if acceptable, be utilized in system) .

An extended school year may be needed for performance of some assigned duties.\r\n\r\nThere will be a savings since the in-service hourly rate we now pay will be absorbed in the lengthened day. We will not have to pay any hourly rate at\r\n\r\nall to career option teachers because the added salary should cover duty beyond the seven hour day.\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION . The compensation paid to program participants is designed to recognize and reward excellence and provide career incentives. Additional compensation will be viewed in this context by our audiences both inside and outside the district. We recognize that an exemplary career program will be seen as\r\n\r\nless distinguished if we payor reward minimally even though the rest of the program remains the same.\r\n\r\nOur recommendation for compensation is as follows:\r\n\r\nCommendation level (first year)\r\n\r\nRegular schedule plus $1500\r\n\r\nCommendation level\r\n\r\nRegular schedule plus $3000\r\n\r\nGreen level\r\n\r\nRegular schedule plus $5000\r\n\r\nBlue level\r\n\r\nRegular schedule plus $10,000\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nRed level\r\n\r\nRegular schedule plus $15,000\r\n\r\nThese rates could be adjusted in future years in accordance with state, federal, or private funding amounts.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL GROUPS Some teachers are not teachers in the traditional sense. Librarians,\r\n\r\nnurses, therapists, etc., present a special problem as regards peer review. We suggest that each of these groups present to the board of governors a standard for excellence applicable to their occupation. A review system will have to be put in place outside the consultant peer review procedures. We will need to be sure that the standard established will result inâˆ‘aopportunities and qualifications roughly equal to those for traditional teachers.\r\n\r\nCANCELLATION The Career Development Plan shall be continued subject to cancellation in its entirety by either the board of education or the Federation on an annual basis. That is the arrangement that has governed the inprog~am.\r\n\r\ntern/intervention\r\n\r\nProposed Time Line\r\n\r\nNovember, 1986 -\r\n\r\nrelease of information to career ladder committee members, teachers and administrators.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1987 -\r\n\r\nrelease of brochure outlining specific details\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\nFeb.-March, 1987 - referendum of the Toledo Federation of Teachers\r\n\r\nApril, 1987 -\r\n\r\nselection of governing board\r\n\r\nMay, 1987 -\r\n\r\napplication process and creation of necessary documents, reference materials, etc.\r\n\r\n-September, 1987\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\ninduction process starts\r\n\r\nA FINAL WORD ABOUT COSTS\r\n\r\nThe initial years of a career ladder as we envision it do not entail large expenditures.Operatio-nal costs will involve hourly pay for governing board members who meet before or after regular hours; an additional salary stipend of about $3,000 for senior consultants called back to service for peer review assignments; the director\'s salary, plus secretarial, supply and equipment expense; and the added stipends of commendation teachers. It\r\n\r\nwi 11 take two years before anyone can reach the Green 1eve 1 of the ladder.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, there will be some costs that can be lumped under the heading of \"publicity.1I This might entail travel or just mailing materials to others who have already begun to request information. Informational\r\n\r\nrequests about the intern program are used as guide in this regard.\r\n\r\nAs the plan progresses into the third year and beyond, the costs will increase because of the added projects and responsibilities that will be assigned to career teachers. It is not clear how much these costs will be,\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\nor just what form they will take.\r\n\r\nWhat, for instance, will be the cost of\r\n\r\nopening up a II res ident scholars ll program at a university? Should such monies be allocated to the university or to the local district?\r\n\r\nSuch questions can only be contemplated. What is clear is that for surprisingly few dollars a three to five year test project can be funded and studied. For reasons previously explained, this should be done by, or\r\n\r\nthrough, the Ohio Department of Education.\r\n\r\nUltimately, a pilot project will allow future costs to be projected with a greater degree of accuracy, permit determination of the proper sources of funding, and develop experience that can lead to greater insight into which, if any, costs should be borne by a local district.\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\n'),(5260,81,2,50,0,'Toledo Career Development Plan for the Professionalization of Teaching'),(6724,80,2,50,0,'Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Career Development Plan'),(5279,79,2,50,0,'FEA/United President Pat Tornillo\'s Comments Before the State Board of Education '),(5298,78,2,50,0,'The Minneapolis Collaborative Plan'),(5334,76,2,50,0,'Career in Teaching Plan'),(5353,75,2,50,0,'Section of contract on professional development'),(5372,74,2,50,0,'Rochester, NY; A Contract of Give and Take for Excellence'),(5391,73,2,50,0,'Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative in Teaching'),(5409,72,2,50,0,'Letter describing the Tennessee Career Plan'),(6743,71,2,50,0,'More Pay for Teachers and Administrators Who Do More: Incentive Pay Programs, 1987'),(5428,70,2,50,0,'Can Merit Pay Work in Education?'),(5447,69,2,50,0,'Recommendations to the Citizens and Government of Florida Concerning Teacher Compensation'),(5504,66,2,50,0,'Teacher Evaluation Plan'),(5521,65,2,50,0,'Teacher evaluation proposal'),(5540,64,2,50,0,'Teacher and Administration Evaluation: the issues from a union perspective'),(5559,63,2,50,0,'Unions, school boards score Regents\' teacher test plan'),(5578,62,2,50,0,'Teacher Testing '),(6623,61,2,50,0,'It may be the teacher\'s turn for testing'),(5597,60,2,50,0,'Remain Committed to Improving Arkansas\' Education'),(7250,59,2,49,0,'Education Reform'),(6762,56,2,50,0,'State Educational Governance through a standard setting; the use of teacher competency testing for teacher certification'),(5654,55,2,50,0,'Competency and testing; a natural affinity.'),(7035,53,2,49,0,'Education'),(5766,49,2,50,0,'Evaluating Teachers'),(5785,48,2,50,0,'Competency tests for teachers?

They provide the clearest example of how a superintendent and teacher union leader can work together to make real, positive educational change. \r\nIt\'s important for you to know --and I am here to tell you --that those of us who closely watch the education reform movement are cheering you on. We \r\nt, \r\nknow that in most places the reform movement has produced little more than rhetoric and that even ~ here you\'re still facing many of the same nittyâ€¢gritty problems we all have. \r\nAlthough in New York we sometimes go a bit far. As I left the city yesterday, for example, I got a quick look at a report of a study our Board of Education had done of its computer division,I,which is working on solving the problem of the paperwork burying our schools. The Division of Computer Information Services, as it\'s called, \"is bogged down in paperwork,\" the study concludes, and recommends computerizing the computer division. \r\nThis is what I call the Educational Twilight Zone, and I can go on with stories. For example: the classroom that was finally divided in half by a wall to accommodate two small special education \r\n..\r\nclasses that had been. sharing one large room. The teachers were overjoyed. Only one problem: the workmen never put an additional light switch in the second room, so every time someone turns the switch off in one room, the lights go out in the other. \r\nOr the lunchtime meeting a principal called, saying it was \"voluntary but essential.\" In other words, you will volunteer. \r\nIt\'s not unusual in education for one thing to be announced and another to be done. That\'s why many of us are healthily skeptical of all the talk about education reform. \r\nAnd that is also why we admire the efforts you are making here. \r\n, \r\n!I \r\n4 \r\n\r\nWe know that in Dade County there are real partnerships, not just rhetorical ones, that those of you in the pilot schools are truly being urged to dream, and your dreams are finding support along the rocky road to becoming reality. \r\nAnd our dreams, after all, really are what schools should be about. \r\nYou know, I grew up just north of here --same beach, same ocean --except for the medical waste in ours --pretty much the same people --in Coney Island. The schools were salvation for me and for all the other kids on my block. I\'m sure the same is true for most of you. Our parents were either first or second qeneration immiqrants. Neither of mine completed hiqh school. They loved me, they wanted me to do better than they had done, and they depended totally on the school for that. \r\nThey depended on the school for a lot. For example, it wasn\'t until first qrade, when the school required eye tests, that they found out I needed eyeqlasses. It wasn\'t until the school required a note from a dentist that I qot taken to one. And it wasn\'t until Miss Bezman in second qrade qave books as qifts for us to take home and keep that they saw and understood that they could do the same to feed my love of readinq. \r\nMy school, PS 188, was warm in winter and in the \r\nsprinq cool breezes came throuqh the open windows \r\nfrom the Bay. The floors were waxed, the doorknobs shiny brass, the wooden desks smooth and polished. It was a special, clean, safe, wondrous place, where a breathtakingly limitless world began to unfold for me. I was intimidated, but I was nurtured and encouraged. \r\nI made special friends, school friends, who were different from my street friends, and who enlarged my world from Neptune Avenue and 31st Street to at least as far as 30 blocks away, where sights and smells and family customs were frequently quite different from mine. \r\nMy mother did the best she could, though it was limited, to support my education. But when, on the eve of my graduation from PS 188, she was informed I\'d passed the test for Hunter College\'s special secondary school, she faltered. She would \r\nnot let me travel to Manhattan --to \"the city\" -â€¢\r\n..\r\nto school every day. And so I went to my neighborhood junior high, then on to James Madison High, a 15-minute bus ride from home. Ordinary neighborhood schools --not magnets, not theme schools. But I got a first-class education. \r\nAnd, to make a long story short, here I am: A success --certainly in my mother\'s eyes ~nd very largely thanks to public schools. \r\nBut today too many of our schools are not providing the same safe havens, and the same road out of poverty, to millions of kids who are just the same as you and I were, and not that long ago. \r\nNot that everything was wonderful then --not by \r\n..\r\nany means. But then the kids who dropped out, who didn\'t make it through --and maybe even most of them didn\'t ended up in manufacturing or industrial jobs that paid decently and enabled them to live decent lives and support families. \r\nSome time ago, the New York Times reported a reunion of the \"Dux\" of Stone Avenue, a basketball team of street kids from PS 184 in Brownsville in the heart of Brooklyn in the 1920s, when Brownsville was predominantly Jewish. The reunion took place here in Florida --where else? --where all of them now live as retirees. What interested me was that hardly any of the teammates had finished high school. Almost all of them dropped out to work. (Let me read a quote from the article) \"\'If you went to high schoolâ€¢â€¢â€¢ \' said one of the men, finishing the sentence with a low, reverent whistle. \'Wow! And college! That was only for the doctors and lawyers.\'\" \r\nIt struck me reading that how the world is indeed different. How many kids without high school diplomas today will get jobs that will allow them to retire to Florida? Or the Southwest, or wherever else people from Miami retire to? None. without a high school education today, a youngster is lost, completely lost. \r\nBut today, even for the kids who struggle to stay in school and manage to do so, the experience is considerably different, especially in our inner cities. \r\nVery few doorknobs are important looking shiny brass. Windows are often broken and dirty. \r\n\'. \r\n\r\nLighting, so important to success in school, is often inadequate. Hallways are dark and dingy, furniture is broken and scarred, supplies and books are old, or vanished, or not enough to go around. \r\nSafety in our poor neighborhoods in urban centers is a major problem. And because of the drug epidemic, children now are carrying guns to school along with their pencils and notebooks. Recently we had the incredible experience of a kindergartner bringing a loaded automatic to a crowded school lunchroom. \r\nMost people reading newspaper accounts of the rioting in Miami a couple of weeks ago I\'m sure didn\'t think about the teachers who go into tough neighborhoods every day. I did, though. I \r\n,: \r\nthought about the teachers trying heroically to make education relevant and important to kids traumatized by the lives they lead --the broken families, the brutal poverty so many of them face. \r\nIn New York City --and I know we\'re not unique,~ despite the attention we qet --children are old before their time. Too many are responsible for themselves at an early age, and usually for siblings as well. Too many of them are introduced to violence and sex before puberty. And the magical world of books that helped save many of us is foreign to these TV-born-and-bred kids for whom headsets and video cassettes bring sensory pleasure which requires little or no exercise of critical thinking skills. \r\nSo what are the schools to do? certainly not what we\'ve been doing for the last 100 years. We cannot continue to run our schools as top-down factories, giving teachers circumscribed orders from on high --and expect this new generation of youngsters to discover the joys of learning. We can\'t just lecture kids who see and talk only pictures, and we can\'t expect teachers to succeed with oversized classes, state-mandated curricula, lack of support for discipline, and the requirement to follow orders and do as they are told. \r\nspend most of my lunchtimes talking with teachers in school cafeterias --or whichever room they brown-bag it in when there is no cafeteria. \r\nÂ·, \r\n13 \r\nNOw, we\'ve come a long way. We finally have \r\ngotten rid of the time clocks we were forced to \r\npunch since the turn of the century, and we\'ve \r\nstarted a lot of school-based programs which give \r\nteachers a great deal of authority in school \r\ndecision-making. We have colleagues with \r\nsupportive principals working together to break \r\n~. \r\nnew ground in teacher-created and directed ungraded primary programs, in team-teaching arrangments in a couple of our huge high schools, and many other projects which never could have happened just two or three years ago. \r\nBut none of it is systemic, as yours is. None of it is being nurtured and driven by a total school system commitment to staff development and support for the intellectual, pedagogical, and practical needs of teachers. \r\nDespite the reform movement, most inner city teachers are isolated in their classrooms, buried in paperwork, bereft of appropriate modern equipment and technology --or even clean new textbooks --and burnt out trying to reach a new generation of incredibly burdened youngsters without the information, support, and different school structure they need to help them. \r\nLet\'s look for a minute or two at our kids. \r\nIn our city --and I\'m sure your situation is similar --40 percent of our youngsters are living at or below the poverty line --not working class poverty, but brutal, inhuman poverty that means \r\nhunger, surroundings filled with prostitution, \r\n..\r\ndrug dealing, addiction, violence, and abuseâ€¢. \r\nNationally, half a million babies are born to teenage mothers each year, and usually they\'ve had no pre-natal care, their birth weight is low, and they are malnourished. By the time they reach school age, they have accumulated large deficits. Thousands are born with AIDS or with a drug addiction. \r\nTens of thousands of our students are homeless, or living in shelters, or doubled up with other families, or even on the streets. \r\nOf course, schools cannot solve all the terrible problems our children live with, but they can make a very great difference. Universal preschools, \r\n~. \r\nstarting at very young ages, make a difference. Breakfast, lunch, and even dinner in schools with extended after-school programs make a difference. Parenting programs, breaking schools down to smaller units where students are less anonymous, work-study arrangements, alternative schools -â€¢all of these make a difference. We fight for them, we support them. \r\nBut when all is said and done, in schools it is the teacher who makes the main difference. No program, no new technology, no matter how excellent --and much of it is --can work without being applied and delivered by the thinking, breathing classroom professional. At bottom, it is the relationship between student and teacher which creates learning. \r\n\". \r\nWhich is why the issue of teacher professionalism \r\nâ€¢\r\nis so central to the ultimate improvement of our schools. \r\nWe must free our teachers from the shackles of 40 or 50 minute periods, from the bus duty, the hall duty, the clerical work, the babysittinq, the toilet patrol. \r\nWe must free our teachers and qive them time -â€¢and pay for their time if it doesn\'t exist within the present school day qive them time to think, to discuss, to share with each other the problems and pains and breakthrouqhs and brainstorms that now they experience only in isolation. When I talk to teachers --when I listen to teachers I hear their need to be respected for what they know --and to search with their colleaques for \r\nsolutions they don\'t now have. \r\n..\r\nIsn\'t it mind-boggling, especially when one thinks of the amount of exchange that goes on in other professions, like law and medicine, that most teachers never see another teacher teach? \r\nOne might almost think schools are organized to divide and conquer --keeping teachers and students contained in their own boxes. \r\nInstead of being organized for cooperation, collegiality, and problem-solving. \r\nIt\'s commonly said, and correctly so, that to meet the demands of today\'s job market, students need to be able to use creativity, imagination, and analytic capacity. They need to be able to adapt to change in the workplace and keep up with new technology. \r\nYet in many of our large schools, all the teachers â€¢ don\'t even know each other well! And they don\'t know what their colleagues know about their very same students. As in other client-centered professions, teachers have to engage in constant feedback, judgment, analysis of progress --in addition to all the caring, human ways they relate to their students. \r\nAnd to do this for today\'s youngsters, with all their problems and differences, teaching needs to be custom-tailored, and teachers have to be able to engage in an ongoing search to find new ways to reach them. \r\nSchools have to be organized so that teachers -â€¢all teachers can meet regularly, perhaps in \r\ndifferent configurations --by grade or department or across disciplines. \r\nTeachers have to meet to share and to make decisions about the assignment of students, courses of study, program development, assessment and evaluation, and their own schedules. \r\nThey have to have the authority, equal to the principal\'s, to determine the organization of the school day and the allocation of the school\'s resources. And here, of course, is where we encounter some problems. \r\nYesterday, I met with UFT members in a typical large high school with an awful dropout rate, and discussed these very issues. The principal, a nice man, an oldtimer, was typically uptight about my visit. I don\'t know why they get that way, but they do. \r\n(I knew I had really made it when schools began to get cleaned up before my scheduled arrival.) \r\nSo --I went to see him with our chapter leader after the union meeting to tell him how interested his staff was in learning about how some other schools had worked on some of the same problems. \r\nsuggested that a staff development day, which happened to be scheduled for next week, could be used to do that, and I offered the resources of the Teacher Center. \r\nBut guess what? Apologetically, regretfully, mournfully, the principal explained he had already fully planned that day for the staff! All by \r\nhimself he had done this, for a staff of close to 300 teachers, without saying a word to anyone of them! \r\nWhat a burden on that poor man! And what a burden that day will be on those poor teachers. As any enlightened, successful principal will tell you -â€¢they too need the sharing. They need to share the responsibility, the risk, the ideas, the problems, the solutions. \r\nNo one can be a true leader without doing that. \r\nAnd no school can fully succeed or solve its problems without an honest partnership among teachers, supervisors, and parents. \r\nWhich brings me back to why what you are doing here in Dade County is so important. In my meetings with teachers in New York, as we struggle to bring our schools into the modern age, we talk about places like Dade County, and Rochester, and Hammond, and Pittsburgh --all AFT cities, by the way --where herculean efforts to reform education, to professionalize teaching are taking place. And we are learning from your work. \r\nWe 	are watching your system\'s commitment to shared \r\n. 	decision-making, and all the difficulties involved in its implementation. We are watching your system\'s commitment to nurturing professionalism, to staff development, to collegiality. We know you still have lots to do --as do our colleagues in Rochester and elsewhere. But we admire the \r\ngreat cooperative efforts you are making and we applaud your successes as they mount. \r\nNew York City and Miami, after all, have a great deal in common --aside from the fact that thousands of our active retired UFT members are here and that hordes of our relatives are here seeking your wonderful sun. \r\nWhat we have in common is that both cities are gateways to the promise of America, with all the wonders and all the woes that brings. \r\nToday, New York City and Miami are exp~riencing a wave of immigration as high as or higher than what passed through Ellis Island in the early years of \r\n\"\". \r\n\r\nthis century. And schools played a central role then, in the lives of our parents and grandparents. \r\nBut our society and the world are very different places in the 1980s from what they were at the turn of the century. First, there is the change from a manufacturing and industrial economy to a service and technological one, which requires at least a high school diploma and probably some college in order to get a job that can support a family. \r\nAnd second, there is much less hope and much more anger among the poor because of the unfulfilled promise of the American Dream. \r\nThe Committee on Economic Development, a national business group devoted to the support of education \r\nreform, said it well in a report they issued called Children in Need: \r\n(And I quote) \"Almost alone among the great nations of the world, the united states cannot be defined in terms of place of origin, race, religion, or ancestry. Instead, our nation is defined by a vision --a dream that welcomes anyone who shares it. \r\nBut this vision is now becoming more distant for a growing underclass of Americans condemned by both discrimination and ignorance to only limited participation in mainstream social, political, and economic life.\" (End quote) This is the business community of America speaking. \r\nIndeed, there is much to worry about --not just that our productivity will fall and we will become \r\na second-or third-rate power because of an \r\n..\r\nunskilled work 	force --though that is a very \r\ngreat danger and we have already started down that \r\nroad. \r\nBut, even worse, there is the danger that the bold and beautiful and unparalled experiment in \r\n\". 	democracy that we represent and that our public schools have nurtured and preserved will falter and die because of our inability to educate the least of us and bring them into the mainstream of American life. \r\nAnd there is the danger that our failure to do so \r\nwill lead to the demise of our public education \r\nsystem itself. \r\nAnd what a tragedy that would be for America. For our children would lose the access we give them to \r\nhistory, to drama, to culture, to life. The language of dreams is learned in school and.can only be taught by teachers who too are free to dream. \r\nI wish you well. I urge you on. On behalf of teachers elsewhere, I applaud -you and I thank you. \r\n, ~. \r\n.:.~ \'I .. \r\nopeiu:153\' afl-cio \r\n'),(7230,83,2,47,0,'CC'),(7231,83,2,51,0,'Document'),(7232,83,2,43,0,'3480079'),(7233,83,2,38,0,'New York City.

MAREC, PRESIDENT \r\nOHIO FEDERATICN OF TEACHERS \r\nAFI\', AFL-CIO \r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 9, 1983 \r\nBefo:re painting too sauber a picture of the state of the teaching profession today, we should look at matters in a historical perspective. Fifty years ago nearly 55 percent of the teaching force did not have the equivalent of two years of training beyond high school. Today nearly half (49.3%) of the teachers in elementary and secondary schools have a master\'s degree or beyond. Starting with the \"nonnal school\" aver the years teacher p:reparation has evolved into a four year curriculum with a general or liberal arts education in addition to professional training. While in canparison to the legal and medical professions, education\'s devel.opnent has lagged behind; nevertheless, progress was made. (It should be recalled that one hundred years ago anyone who could read and write could claim legal expertise on the AIrerican frontier and the state of the madical arts could be surrmed up in the notto, \"When in doubt, cut it off!\") \r\nNonetheless, today the status and image of teachers both within their CMI\'l ranks and in the eyes of much of the public is in a critical state. In a recent survey, more than one-third of .America\'s Â·Â·teachers stated that they either certainly or probably would not becare a teacher is they had a chanCe to do it over again. Twenty years ago only eleven percent reported they would certainly or probably not choose teaching again. Furthenrore, in 1982, only 5 percent of all college-bound high school seniors said they planned to pursue a major in education. Consequently, while the news nedia has recently highlighted the. shortage of math and science teachers, the United States faces in the ca:ning years a shortage in most teaching fields. Additionally, recent studies indicate that the majority of students nON enrolling in teacher education are in the bottom third of their graduating \r\n.high school class. (An excellent and readable report on the current status of the nation\'s teachers is C. Emily Ferstritzer\'s The .American Teacher, Washtngton, D.C.: Ferstritzer Publications, 1983.) â€¢\r\nFrom the standpoint of the 1Imerioan public, the 1982 Gallup Poll revealed only 8 percent of the general public gave public schools an A rating (down fran 18% in 1974), 29% a B rating, and 33% a C, hCMever, only 5% gave them an F. The major problems that the public sees in our public schools are, in their rank order, \"lack of discipline,\" \"lack of proper financial support,\" \"use of drugs\" and \"poor curriculum\". \r\nFran the viewpoint of teachers, the reasons why ed,ucation is not an attractive occupation \r\nare: \r\n\r\n(1) 	\r\nPublic attitudes tcMard public schools. With only 30% of the families in the nation having school-age children, derogator.y attitudes are often the result hearsay. Studies indicate the greater the contact with the public schools, the more favorable the i.rrg;>ression of the educational system. \r\n\r\n(2) 	\r\nThe treatment of education by the media which is usually unfavorable. \r\n\r\n(3) 	\r\nI.J:::M salaries paid teachers. In 1980-81, the average beginning teacher\'s salary was estimated at $11,758 compared to $20,136 for college graduates with a degree in engineering; $15,720 for beginning accountants; $14,100 in business; $14,472 in economics; $15,936 in sales marketing; and $17,712 in ccmputer services. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe disparity over tine increases between teachers and those in other proâ€¢fessional and technical occupations. For example, a beginning accountant in 1981 earned an average of $16,529, but a grade 5 accountant demanded a salary of $35,141. An engineer who began at $21,000 could at grade 8 earn alnost $57, 000. No a:mpa.rab1e advancement salary scale exists for teachers. \r\n\\ -~ \r\n(4) U::M status of teachers in the ccmnunity. \r\nTo address many of the factors cited above, the Chio Federation of Teachers would recarm:md , . the foll.cMing: \r\nI. The Establishment of Teacher Corrpetency Entrance Level Examinations \r\nWe believe that a bias free examination to qualify candidates for the teaching proâ€¢\r\nfession as part of a full teacher education \'degree program which tests the level of \r\nliteracy, knCM\'ledge of subject matter, and pedagogy will enhance the image of teachers \r\nin their CMl1 eyes but also upeJrade the profession in the eyes of the general public. \r\nSuch a test will not necessarily shCM\' who is a \"good\" teacher, but it will indicate \r\nwho has the necessary basic skills and knCMledge. \r\nIt must also be stated that the OET opposes the use of examinations\'for decisions related to retention, prarotion; recertification, salary, or tenure. Retesting is not required of lawyers, doctors, real estate agents and other professionals. In equity, it should not be required of teachers. We would also oppose canpetency tests that are solely or largely ooncerned with nethodology. \r\nTeacher canpetency exams are only one elenent of what is needed to raise the status of teachers and education in our society. Other elements must also be put in place. \r\nII. The Establishment of High Standards for Admission to Colleges of Education \r\nThe OET well understands that colleges facing declining enrollrrents and program cutâ€¢backs seek \"bodies\" to fill their classroans. The temptation is there to make lax admission policies in teacher education even more lenient in light of \"eoonomic necessity.\" However, to upgrade American public education, the AFT supports the developoont and enforcenent of standards for entrance into teacher preparation. The process of separating the wheat fran the chaff should begin at the entrance doors to our oolleges of education. It should be noted that in establishing admissions standâ€¢ards the AFT is opposed to any proposal necessitating quotas. \r\nIII. Inproved Content and Instruction in Colleges of Education \r\nIt is no secret that oolleges of education are held in lCM\' esteem by other segments of the university canmunity and by large numbers of graduates fran oolleges of eduâ€¢cation. \"Educators\" have for sare time suggested that a fifth or sixth year be added to teacher preparation. HCM\'ever, before OET oould support such a oourse of action, oolleges of education will have to deIoonstrate that they truly have sanething to offer the prospective teacher. Besides, it is unlikely that many students would put this additional invesbnent into their\'educationÂ·without much higher eoonanic rewards-than teaching currently offers. \r\nIt should not be concluded that AFT and OFI\' oppose increased demands on education students in tenns of greater knCM\'ledge of subject matter and practical experiences via student teaching, microteaching, simulations and roodeling. But simply adding m:>re of the Sam3 in terms of education courses is not conducive to upgrading the profession. We would offer as a IIOre practical and realistic means of resolving the titre issue, the establishIrent of internship programs in our public school systems. The Toledo Board of Education and the Toledo Federation of Teachers have cooperatively developed such a program, and it is worthy of study by others. \r\n-3â€¢\r\nThe state of Oklahana has taken the greatest strides in this area. The Oklahana \r\nstate legislature in 1980 made sweeping changes in its teacher education program \r\nwhich include (a) increasing the standards of admission into colleges of education; \r\n(b) nore clinical field work in the preparation process; (c) Competency examinations in subject areas before graduating; (d) an entry year internship before certificaâ€¢tion; (e) the IOOnitoring of first-year teachers by a team representative\' of the proâ€¢fession, and (f) provisions for continuing education for teachers and teacher educators. \r\nIV. Inpmved Teacher Inservice and Professional DeveloprrEIlt\' for the practicing Teacher \r\nThe OFT does not endorse the current maudlin practices that are often passed off as teacher inservice in many of our school systans. But, we do feel that if teacher organizations had a greater role in the establishment and direction of inservice training, intellectually stimulating programs could be developed that would fill in gaps in subjectrnatter, improve instructional management, introduce technological advances, and bring out the application of sound research. \r\nv. The Need for Teachers\' to Reach out to the COrrmunity-At-Large \r\nThe \"image\" problems of teachers today are, as stated before, due in large part to public perceptions and the reporting of the news media. With fewer families having school-age children, it is necessary for teachers to reach out to the comnunity-atâ€¢large to change those p~ceptions. \r\nThe AFT has long recognized that need and is one of the factors which determined our affiliation with Organized Labor. \r\nHavever, teachers and other school personnel must seek larger and newer coalitions. AFT President Shanker has for the last few years pushed for a greater dialogue with the business community. Many leaders of business do realize that for their own selfâ€¢interest and that of the nation, public education needs to be irrq;>roved. Important figures in the business caumunity recognize that irrq;>rovement will necessitate massive infusions of rroney into education. They, of course, will have demands attached to their support of education. President Shanker has asked our unions not to reject\' nor accept at face value the suggestions put forward, but rather to seize the opporâ€¢tunity to negotiate change. \r\nAdditionally, there are a variety of ways \'local teacher organizations can reach out to the public. The Youngstown Federation of Teachers\' \"Dial-A~Teacher Program\" and \"Project Reach OUt\" for children of the unerrployed are two examples. The fonner has been successfully used by teacher unions in other parts of the country. The latter is a pilot program that has had only lirnited success but is an effort wOrth trying. \r\nIt should be noted that programs such as these in YoungstCMn or the Toledo Intern Program must have their origin and source of support in the teachers of the school system. They cannot be arbitrarily irrq;>osed from above by management and be successful. \r\nFinally, teacher organizations can, with what resources they can muster, seek to use the media to change public perceptions of our education system. The four public serâ€¢vice announcements for TV prepared by AFT and shCMn around the country are examples of what can be done with limited resources.

We should do \r\nmore to applaud our successes. Outstanding pe~formances in \r\nmathematics in classrooms from Montgomery County, Maryland, to \r\nEast Los Angeles, California, do not make headlines, nor does the \r\nmainstreaming of handicapped students. We too easily ignore the \r\nincreased integration of student bodies in colleges and universities\', \r\nand we do not relate that to what has been good in our \r\nelementary and secondary schools. l-\'1e tend to concentrate our \r\nattention on the failures. \r\n\r\n\'/---------..-r\';\"\',---~--....-.,-~---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPage Two \r\n\r\nBut there can be no denying that there are serious problems, \r\nand if we fail to confront those problems we shall imperil the \r\nfuture economy and security of this country. Those problems vary \r\nfrom homes that do not encourage study to a curriculum that is \r\nnot adequate in its challenge.

In the 1973-74 \r\n\r\nschool year, the United States spent $43.7 billion on instruction \r\n\r\nin the public schools: $21.4 billion went to teacher salaries. \r\n\r\nLast year public school expenditures for the nation added up to \r\n\r\n$106 billion. Teacher salaries made up $43.9 billion of the \r\n\r\ntotal. \'\'ihile education expendit:-ures have gone up, the proportion \r\n\r\nof the money spent on teacher salaries has fallen, and the \r\n\r\nproportion of the instructional dollar earmarked for other ser\r\n\r\n\r\nvices and ~ersonnel has increased. \' \r\n\r\nWhat statement does our nation make when podiatrists are \r\nrequired to study lenger, face mu~h more vigorous career entrance \r\ntests, and are paid considerably more than teachers? \\fuat statement \r\ndo we make when we offer teachers few incentives and \r\ninadequate compensation but constantly increase their responsibilities? \r\nWhat statement does our nation make when we fail to \r\nconvey the simple message to students, their parents and teachers \r\nthat education is important? \r\n\r\nSchool administrators and boards of education must help \r\ncreate an atmosphere in which education can thrive and learning is \r\nencouraged and respected. That:means fewer excuses to cut classes, \r\nfewer interruptions by public address systems and less scheduling \r\nof events that reduce classroom time. Teachers sense that a \r\n\r\n\" \r\n\r\nschool administration \'believes their role is, important not only \r\nwith the salary level offered, but also when they feel the \"little\" \r\n\r\nactions by a school administratipn support the teachers\' activities \r\n\r\nand educational endeavors. \r\n\r\n\r\nPage Four \r\n\r\nEducation is an opportunity, but it is an opportunity which \r\nrequires partnership --among levels of government, the community, \r\nparents, teachers and students. If we are \"a nation at risk\" as \r\nstated in the recent National Commission on Excellence in Education \r\nreport and we share their serious concerns about educational \r\ndeficiencies then the risk is posed not only by educational \r\nsystems, but by this nation walking the path of indifference, \r\nlack of commitment and inadequate funding. However, there is \r\ntoday substantial evidence that the American public wants to \r\nimprove our schools and that they are willing to pay the bill. \r\n\r\nBACKGROUND AND FINDINGS \r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1983, Representative Carl Perkins, Chairman \r\nof the Education and Labor Committee of the House of Representatives, \r\nappointed a Task Force on Merit Pay to review the issue of \r\nmerit pay for educators and issue a report.

Smith, Executive Director, \r\nCouncil for American \r\nPrivate Education \r\n\r\nThe Task Force heard witnesses from three major commissions \r\n\r\non education which had recently issued reports, in addition to \r\n\r\nreceiving testimony from Governors, State Legislators, deans of \r\n\r\nschools of education, students, teachers, principals and school \r\n\r\nboard members. \r\n\r\nWitnesses who came before the Task Force agreed that our \r\n\r\n-\'--1\'\r\n\r\neducational system is confronting a crisis in the number of \r\nhigh quality teachers entering and remaining in the profession. \r\nLow salaries for elementary and secondary school teachers have \r\nalways been the-dominant patter~ of compensation in this nation, \r\nbut the problem is now worsening. Women and minorities serving \r\nin the field of teaching have provided a form of Â·controlled, \r\n\r\nPi \r\n\r\n\r\nPage Six \r\n\r\nin-kind subsidy to public education. However, expanding oppor\r\n\r\n\r\ntunities for women and minorities in other professions have \r\n\r\ndecreased this traditional pool of teacher candidates. \r\n\r\nStudents are not being encouraged to become teachers. Far \r\ntoo often the ablest young people feel challenged by opportunities \r\nin law, medicine and engineering rather than teaching. \r\nAcademic scores \r\n\\ \r\nfor education majors, measured by college entrance \r\nexaminations and grade point averages, show a marked decline \r\nover the l~st decade. Although test scores measure talent, they \r\ncannot gauge qualities such as dedication and love for children. \r\nBut it is probable that these latter qualities are present in the \r\nsame numbers among students with high test scores as among students \r\nwith low test scores. The fact that some of these qualities are \r\ndifficult to measure should not be used to camouflage a major \r\neducational problem in the nation. Too often we are not attracting \r\n\r\nÂ·the finest students to teaching,. and too often we are not \r\n\r\nkeeping the finest teachers. These generalized truths, however, \r\n\r\nshould not detract from another reality: we are still attracting \r\n\r\nand keeping many fine teachers. They deserve our gratitude, and \r\n\r\nthey deserve it in more concrete terms than they are now receiving \r\n\r\nit. \r\n\r\nTeachers should not be the sole focus of questions about the \r\nquality of education. Social problems, such as drug and alcohol \r\nabuse, have disrupted the education process. Changing family \r\npatterns have created additional problems for the educational \r\nsystem. Lower college admission standards have led to reduced \r\nhigh school graduation requirements. The Carnegie Foundation for \r\n\r\n\r\nthe Advancement of T.eaching has found that electives and .courses \r\n\r\nthat demand too little of students have multiplied, while the \r\n\r\nnumber of courses required for all students has declined and \r\n\r\nattendance at the more academically rigorous classes has fallen. \r\n\r\nA host of other things Â·could be mentioned. \r\n\r\nYet the key educational role played by teachers suggests \r\nthat the most rapid improvement in education may be made by \r\nupgrading that profession. In recent months, policy makers and \r\neducators have increased their interest in merit pay as one \r\nmethod to attract and retain the most able teachers. \r\n\r\n\'\\ \r\n\r\nEXISTING OR PROPOSED MERIT PAY OR CAREER LADDER PLANS \r\n\r\nExisting or proposed plans of performance-based pay take two \r\ngeneral forms: merit pay and a structured advance system, somet~\r\nmes called the career ladder approach. \r\n\r\nMerit pay is a system that rewards exemplary teaching by \r\neither a bonus or an increased annual salary. The career ladder \r\nsystem creates levels of teachers from apprentice teacher \r\nthrough several intermediate steps to the highest level of master \r\nteacher. Different salaries and responsibilities are associated \r\nwith each step on the career ladder. \r\n\r\nThere are several examples of merit payor master teacher \r\nplans now being debated in various state legislatures. Local \r\nschool districts in Houston, Texas~ Lower Dauphin, Pennsylvania~ \r\nand Seiling, Oklahoma; and many others have implemented plans \r\nwhich follow the basic patterns. Many private schools have used \r\nmerit pay plans for decades. \r\n\r\n-: . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPage Eight \r\nMerit paVe This reward system attempts to base salary on \r\n\r\nperformance. The performance gauged may be by the individual teacher, \r\nan individual classroom, or meeting school-wide or district-wide goals. \r\nFor example, an individual teacher may meet performance standards \r\nof increased reading ability in the classroom and receive merit \r\npay. A school building of grades K-6 may see a mUlti-class \r\nincrease ih standardized scores for students and all teachers in \r\nthat building may be rewarded. A school district may set system-\r\nwide goals such as general levels of increased competency in \r\nreading and writing, access for all students and increased attendance \r\nfor teachers and students. Teachers fulfilling these \r\nsystem-wide goals would receive merit pay. \r\n\r\nMerit pay defines the reward for performance in dollar \r\nterms, although this may include sabbaticals, tu~tionÂ· assistance \r\nor other bonuses. \r\n\r\nUnder merit pay systems, there often is no sustained pay \r\nincrease, although teach~rs may be eligible each year. There is \r\nno increase in duties per ~, nor is a \"merit\" teacher differentiated \r\nfrom other teachers through special recognition. \r\n\r\n~Career Ladder System. This system creates tiers from \r\nentrY level through master teacher with varying pay and responsibilities \r\nat each level. The designation of master teacher is \r\njudged by panels composed of teachers, administrators, school \r\nboard members and parents or variations of this combination. \r\nThe master teacher has an extended contract, along with a substantial \r\nsalary differential from lower levels of teachers. A \r\nmaster teacher might have responsiblities which include developing \r\ncurriculum, aiding other teacher~ in the classroom and serving \r\non panels to evaluate others to be master teachers. \r\n\r\n\r\n. \":-. \r\n\r\n\r\n. Page Nine \r\n\r\nAn example of a career ladder would be: \r\n\r\n* \r\nApprentice Teacher --Must meet all state requirements. for \r\ninitial certification and hold degree from an accr~dited \r\ncollege or university. Entry-level salary of at least \r\n$15,000. \' \r\n* \r\nProfessional Teacher --fully certified teacher with five \r\nyears\' experience and at least four positive, annual evaluations \r\nand some in-service training or postgraduate course work. \r\nBase Fifth Year Salary $20,000. \r\n* \r\nSenior Teacher --certified teacher, Master\'s degree in \r\ndiscipline taught or area of concentration, and at least \r\n8 of ~O positive annual evaluations. Base Tenth Year \r\nSalary $30,000. * \r\nMaster Teacher --certified teacher, \'best practice\' \r\ndemonstrated, additional study beyond Master\'s degree, \r\nmore than ten years of consistently positive evaluations, \r\nwilling to accept in-service or summer-training responsibility \r\nfor other teachers. Base Pay afte\'r Tenth Year \r\nwhen requirements met $35,000. Minimum Annual Bonus for \r\ncontinuing positive evaluations and in-service contribution \r\n$10,000. \r\nThe experience of proposed and existing systems merit pay raises \r\n\r\nmany \r\nquestions that must be carefully examined, including: \r\n\r\nWhat \r\ncriteria are to be used to determine merit?\r\n\r\n* \r\n\r\n* \r\nWho is to establish and judge merit? How are teachers \r\nto be involved in the e,stablishment of a merit payor \r\nstructured elevation plan? \r\nWhat \r\nappeal mechanism is included in the process?\r\n\r\n* \r\n.\r\n, \r\n\r\n* \r\nCan these plans address other problems in the classroom \r\nand school system? \r\nPolls show that both the public and educators are willing \r\n\r\nto move ahead with some form of performance-based pay, and we \r\n\r\napplaud that attitude, but no one should be deceived that its \r\n\r\nachievement is easy. Experience suggests that it is not. There \r\n\r\nis no plan that is acceptable to all. But the fact that there \r\n\r\nare problems should not cause immediate rejection of the idea . \r\n\r\n. \"..SAÂ¥]. ,!14, \r\n. .4 \r\n\r\n.. \r\n\r\n. .\". ~ .. \r\n\r\n\r\nPage Ten\' \r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS \r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance-based pay as a method to elevate the teaching \r\nprofession cannot be viewed in isolation. Tho\'se who, view merit \r\npay as some easy, inexpensive, painless method of solving the \r\nnation\'s education problems are not realistic. Merit pay is but \r\none of many pieces in a puzzle. It can be an important piece( \r\nbut it is neither inexpensive nor easy to achieve, and other \r\npieces of the puzzle must be put into place also. In some school \r\ndistricts perf\'orrnance-based pay will result in an improved educational \r\nproduct, and an ability to attract and keep high quality \r\nteachers; in other school districts, for a variety of reasons, it \r\n\r\n, , \r\n\r\nmay not work. From our deliberations, this Task Force has determined \r\nthat the question the n<:,-tion must face is not, simply how to \r\nimplement performance-based pay for educators but how we can lift \r\nthe standards of instruction in the nation. \r\n\r\nWe recommend: \r\n\r\n1. School districts and states must raise the basic pay of \r\nteachers. Without this, other steps will have limited impact. \r\nWe recognize this is easier to recommend than to achieve, but \r\n. I \r\n\r\nit is an essential action. \r\n\r\n2.

Despite mixed and inconclusive results with performance-\r\nbased pay in the private sector and in education, we support and \r\nencourage experiments with performance-based pay. States, such \r\nas Tennessee, California, Florida, and Oklahoma; which appear to \r\nbe on the verge of major experiments, should share their experience \r\nwith others. The Department of Education, perhaps through the \r\nNational Institute of Education, should evaluate the experience \r\nof states and school districts and disseminate its information \r\nwidely. \r\nThe opportunity for economic improvement and professional \r\nadvancement for a teacher should not be dependent on moving into \r\nschool administration. A superior teacher should be able to \r\nreceive a superior salary. No state pays a good teacher more \r\n\r\n\r\n-than an average or a poor teacher. Polls have shown that the \r\npublic regards this fact as an impediment to improving teacher \r\nperformance. \r\n\r\nExperiments in performance-based pay should include the \r\nfollowing features: \r\n\r\n\r\nA.

In developing criteria and procedures to be used in \r\nmerit pay systems, special care should be taken to avoid abuses \r\nthat would grant rewards for reasons other than outstanding \r\nteacher performance. \r\nC. All teachers participating in such programs should be \r\naff6rded periodi~ review. Incentives should be built in for \r\nteachers to continue self-improvement. \r\nD. Once established, the system should be subject to periodic \r\nreview for refinement, improvement or abandonment. \r\nE. In establishing some form of performance-based pay, a \r\nschool district should recognize the needs and contributions \r\nof competent teachers who do not fall into a superior category. \r\nThese teachers are the lifeblood of the school system. \r\n4. College and university presidents should consider the level \r\nof institutional support given to their departments of education \r\nand increase the percentage of the budget that is directed to \r\nteacher education. Departments of education should be encouraged \r\nto assess their programs and to consider increasing entrance \r\nst~ndards and developing more rigorous course work requirements \r\nfor students. Colleges and universities should develop strategies \r\nto build more effective elementary and secondary school-college\r\n. \r\n\r\npartnerships. The federal government should assist collegiate \r\ndepartments of education to upgrade programs, and to build and \r\nenhance the higher education and K-12 relationship. \r\n\r\nne , ._ \'. \"\" \r\n.ji.,.... \r\n\r\nPage Thirteen \r\n\r\n5. School districts should devote at least three percent of \r\ntheir budget to faculty growth and development. \r\n\r\nThis can take any number of avenu\'es, from guest lectures, to \r\nbringing in outstanding teachers from other areas for evaluation \r\n(which should be ~ore than judgment: it should help a teacher \r\nimprove) to an annual award of an opportunity to travel or study \r\nabroad for an outstanding teacher in each school building, perhaps \r\nselected by his or her peers. \r\n\r\n6. ~federal government should inaugurate ~ expansion of \r\nthe summer institutes and other inservice training opportunities \r\nfor educators that are ~part of the science-math-foreign \r\nlanguage bills pending in the Senate ~passed by the House. \r\nSuch institutes should be availabl~ for approximately 200,000 of \r\nelementary and secondary school teachers each year beginning with \r\nthe summer of 1985. The institutes would include advanced \r\ninstruction in subject matter, updating teaching techniques and \r\nevaluating teacher performance. \r\n7. School districts should institute a system of sabbatical \r\nleaves for educators. \r\nThis should include encouragement for further study, research \r\nand foreign study and travel. / . \r\nSelect~on should be based on \r\nobjective criteria. \r\n\r\n8. ~ scholarship program available to the brightest high \r\nschool graduates should be inaugurated by the federal government. \r\nSuch a program should be available regardless of need, requiring \r\nthe student who accepts the scholarship --at perhaps $5,000 a \r\nyear --to teach for two years for each year of scholarship ,help, \r\nt i \r\n\r\n. ~. \r\n\r\n....-..-.. \r\n\r\n\r\nPage Fourteen \r\n\r\nor to repay the scholarship at prevailihg interest rates if \r\nanother field is chosen. If 10,000 sch\"olarships were made \r\navailable --twenty-three in each congressional district --to \r\nthe top five percent of a high school graduating class, the cost \r\n\r\nwould be $50 million per year at the most, a modest investment \r\n\r\nwhich would payoff many times over. \r\n\r\n9~ A\'talented teacher fellowship program should be \r\ninauqurated by the federal government, to begin in 1985. Each \r\nyear teachers in each congressional district would be selected \r\nby a process similar to selection of \"Teacher of the Year\" or \r\nby a national selection board, to be awarded a year\'s salary and \r\na one-year\"le~ve of absence from their local school district, for \r\nadditional study, research or travel than can be demonstrated to \r\nimprove the teaching strengths of the individual or the teaching \r\nstrength of others. The award should be provided with the stipulation \r\nthat the awardee will return to the same school to teach \r\nfor at least two years following the one-year fellowship. \r\n\r\n10. School districts should regularly and\' carefully evaluate \r\nadministrative personnel. Special attention should be paid to \r\nprincipals. School after school has discovered that a change in \r\nprincipal can result in either marked improvement or marked \r\ndeterioration of the educational product and the atmosphere in \r\nwhich teachers must work. \r\n11. Experimentation in organizational styles for school \r\ndistricts and schools should be undertaken to improve the work \r\nenvironment for teachers. School officials can call on the \r\ncombined intelligence and experience of business and industry, \r\nand, where appropriate, develop business-school partnerships \r\n4.P 4Â£Â¥Ti1 \r\nJ. , . ?4. q ~ i .. , _~ \r\n\r\nPage Fifteen \r\n\r\nfor improving school management. Experiments could include \r\nrestructuring the supervision of teachers, introducing participatory \r\nmanagement and adapting quality circles and other \r\nmethods used in industry to increase productivity. \r\n\r\n12. \"Action must be taken to address school discipline and violence \r\nproblems. One important st~p is the establishment of alternative \r\neducation settings for chronically disruptive or violent children. \r\nStudents who consistently act out in the regular classroom not \r\nonly fail to learn, but also are an impediment to the education \r\nof all other children. \r\n13. Federal research agencies and bodies should make grants to \r\nseveral independent, educational research organizations ~ \r\nindividuals for the purpose of developing objective criteria and \r\nteacher performance evaluation models ~could be used to \r\nimplement performance-based pay systems. Results from such \r\nresearch should be made available to states or local school \r\ndistricts to assist them in their development of performancebased \r\npay systems. \r\nThe national self-examination of education that is now taking \r\nplace should be more than a fad, and if it is sustained with the \r\ntype of follow-through suggested in this report, the nation will \r\nbe better, both in the quality of its life and in its economy. \r\nThe recommendations in this report will result in modest increases \r\nin expenditures by federal, state and local resources, but is an \r\nincrement that will be repaid many times over, both economically \r\nand culturally.

There must be a simpler,. \r\nfairer way.\" If you think this is the statement of a member of . the education establishment or a teacher union leader, you\'re wrong .. It\'s the position of a business executive, Edward Mandt, vice presi-1. dent for personnel at Maccabees Mutual Life Jnsurance Company\' (Southfield, Michigan), in an article, \"Who Is Superior and Who\'s Merely Very Good\'r in the April issue of across tlae boart~, the \r\nmagazine of The Conference Board. . \r\nMand says, correctly, that the current debate over merit pay for teachers \"assumes that business actually has a rational system of paying according to performance. The truth is business merely acts and talks as if it does.\" . .1 \r\nWhen businesses were relatively small, extra reward-ment . pay-was given (when the company was inakingmoney) on the \r\nI \r\nbasis of the personal knowledge and judgment of the top managers .. \'\'\'As businesses grew and became more complicated,\" Mandt says, \"it\' became impossible for top management to make sound decisions\' about the worth of subordinates several rungs lower.\" This resulted in \"objective\" systems, evaluation manuals, etc., but, \"Unfortunâ€¢ately, broad-based merit-pay programs simply do not work.\" . \r\nMandt cites other authorities who came to the saine conclusion as long as 30 years ago. One said, \"Developing and implementing a merit-rating system, and making it work, is not an easy accomplishâ€¢ment; the skeletons of many systems that have failed and have been discarded are testimony to the fact that there are many pi1falls that the unwary (or even the wary!) can stumble into in the\' process.\" Another expert reported, \"Managers and employees in many com-. panies have come to dislike merit rating. In fact,. this dislike has reached the point in some organizations where\'true merit rating has either undergone significant modification or has been completely \r\nabandoned.\" \r\n\r\n:t \r\nOne problem with merit rating is that as many as 80% of em-. ployees believe they are \"above average\" or higher. Merit rating will tell up to 40% that they are not nearly as good as t~ey think they are. \'\'To protect their self-esteem,\" says Mandt, \"they will automatically \r\n\\ accuse the company, their bosses, and ibe system of bias.\" Mandt is not saying that everything is subjective, but merit. ratings are mostly opinion. \"In any organization it is relatively easy to identify the extremes-what \'some writers have called the \'stars\' and \'dogs.\' So far as the rest of the organization is concerned, the best we can do is to make some very rough estimates. As a result, We create unnecessary stress and dissatisfaction when w~ try to make . salary adjustments based on imprecise and largely :mbjective evaluaâ€¢tions, How can any supervisor be confident that the employee who is \r\nâ€¢ rated:satisfactory\' is truly performing slightly below one who is rated \'above average\'? And, even if he could, how can the organization be assured, that one supervisor\'s \'satisfactory\' is equal to another\'s in\' a different department? ... There\'s nothing wrong with my baving an opi(lion that one of my subordinates is doing a satisfactory job and\' another performing at a sli!!htly above-average level. Where I\'ll get into trouble is wh~n I then decide to give one a S percent raise and the other 7 percent.\" . . \'. . . \r\nMandt\'s most syrprising point is that merit pay plans don\'t work because \"Nobody has faitl, ;11 them. Supervisors, in particular, ar~ disbelievers, and are continually undermtning the system. Let\'s face it, the typical competent supervisor is a teain builder and a team leader. He knows the strengths and limitations of his team. He also knows that it\'s dangerous to highlight any of the weaknesses in a fonnal performance appraisal if these will be reviewed by anyone else in connection with salary decisions.\" To maintain the support \r\n, and loyalty of their teams, most supervi~ors wilt not follow merit guidelines established at the top level. \'Rather, they will fight for their own people, \"negotiate\" for them, give them higher ratings than the top brass called for. \"What\'s important to remember,\" writes Mandt, \r\n-\"\"is that in this process the supervisors and their subordinates regard themselves as being outside the company. In effect, they are atl comâ€¢petitors in a game of Monopoly, scheming to .get as much as they can. It\'s not their money; it\'s the company\'s. If they fail, [supervisors) can alwllYs tell their subordinates that they did t~eir best and show the inflated ratings as proof.\" .\r\nI \r\ni When it\'s all ~ver, if it comes to pass that one supervisor did a better job of delivering merit raises than another-the latter loses \r\n. face. And the system falls into total disrepute when \"it further turns out (as also invariably happens) that some of the \'winners\' in the . game are not highly regarded by the \'losers.\' \" \r\nIn rejecting merit pay Mandt is not saying that it\'s atl hopeless and the quest for excellence must be abandoned. On the contrary, he supports setting up \"a performance appraisal system that focuses on performance not pay.\" And, lie says, \"it\'s critical to the plan tbat the company take an uncompromising stand with regard to poor perâ€¢formers. Poor performance mllst be quickly upgraded or terminated.\" Mandt outlines a compensation program which aims to attract comâ€¢petent personnel, to provide incentiyes for performance and for individual development and to recognize long service. His proposals deserve serious study, and his demolition of merit pay ought to settle the question once and for all. Of course, it won\'t-because even though it\'s unworkable, it\'s politically popular. \r\nIndividual copies of the April issue of across the board are available al $3 per copy from Publications Sales, The Conferend: Hoard, 845 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022. \r\nCI 1~8. b, Ai~tn SIl,nhr.

By 1946, 40 percent of all school systems had adopted the single salary schedule, and four years later, 97 percent of all districts having salary schedules were using it. In the three \"decades that followed, experimentation with merit pay as an alternative \r\nto  the  single  salary  schedule  met  with  little  success.  In  \r\nfact,  today  only  four  percent  of  all  systems  use  some  form  \r\nof merit pay.  \r\nEarly  in\' 1983,  it  appeared  that  merit  pay,  for  all  \r\npractical  purposes,  was  dead.  Lending  credence  to  this  \r\n\r\nassumption was an Educational Research Service report which examined the experiences of 239 school distriÂ·cts that tried merit pay and rejected it. Failure most often was attributed to administrative and personnel problems. More specifically, the ERS study citedÂ·Â· obstacles such as, \"not enough data to support evaluation,\" \"no assurance that ratings were accurate,\" \"too heavy a burden on a limited number of administrators,\" and \"parents wanted children taught by superior teachers.\" These findings supported teachers\' strongly held view that \r\nmerit pay plans were based on favoritism rather than merit \r\nand led to demoralization and inequities, rather than improved performance. \r\nThen came \"A Nation At Risk,\" the report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education established by the Reagan Administration. Concluding that schools in this country faced \r\n\"rising tide of. mediocrity,\" the Commission made 36 recommendations intended to raise levels of excellence and standards in public education. Among them was a proposal that \"salaries for the teaching profession should be increased and should be professionally competitive, market-sensitive and performance-based. Salary, promotion, tenure and retention decisions should be tied to an effective evaluation system that includes peer review, so that superior teachers can be rewarded, average ones encouraged, and poor ones either improved or terminated.\" Also, it recommended a three-tiered career ladder for teachers. \r\nNow came curtain call for the two teacher unions. Ignoring the healthy attention given in the report to the need for stronger academic curriculum requirements; higher standards in schools, colleges and universities; better utilization of instructional time; improvements in teacher preparation and teacher recruitment incentives; increased teacher salaries; and improved working conditions, the NEA took a defensive position, claiming the report dismissed the many positive accomplishments of the schools.* Simultaneously, the NEA directed a disproportionate amount of media attention to one \r\n*The report did do this but served its intended purpose of mobilizing the public. \r\nof the 36 recommendations by concentrating most of its responses on denunciations of \"merit pay.\" (The term \"merit pay\" was not actually used by the Commission.) \r\nAlthough the AFT has vigorously opposed traditional merit pay schemes, it assumed a much different posture in responding to the Commission report and to similar conclusions of other education task forces which followed. AFT President Albert Shanker urged teachers to consider what was happening in the present and not give a knee-jerk type of response to things that happened in the past. Teachers now were confronted with \"some of the greatest opportunities that we have ever faced in terms of improving schools, improving the conditions of teachers, improving the salaries of teachers, improving our status.\" \"The future of public education,\" he continued, \"will largely depend on how we respond to what they. are proposing. \" These remarks were included in a speech to the New York State United Teachers Convention in late April and were reiterated in a New York Times column, \"Where We Stand,\" on May 8, 1983. Following this, in an Education Week interview, both Shanker and an NEA vice president agreed that increasing teacher salaries across-the-board would be more effective in attracting and retaining teachers than reliance on school officials to administer merit pay programs. But, in contrast to NEA\' s outright rejection of merit pay, Shanker expressed a willingness \"to consider merit pay proposals under three conditions: if judgments were made by \'somebody teachers had confidence in;\' if the plan didn\' t create a â€¢super salary \r\nfor some paople to keep the rna jority of teachers at a low \r\nsalary;\' and if the plan \'actually helped teachers teach or helped the school perform in a better way.\'\" \r\nDelegates to the 1983 AFT Convention in July reaffirmed this position. While deploring the misguided preoccupation with the idea that incentive payor discretionary merit pay is the most important cure for what ails the teaching profession, the convention resolution on education reform acknowledged that \"some of the more recent proposals allowing advancement of large numbers of teachers to \'master teacher\' type career roles involving extra pay warrant consideration.\" Delegates then established guidelines for discussions o~ career ladder progr.ams. Plans, it was advised, should include the following criteria: \r\n* 	\r\nsubstantially higher pay for all teachers; \r\n\r\n* \r\nnewly negotiated\' evaluation procedures that offer protection against subjectivity and politics; \r\n\r\n* 	\r\nno sanctions against teachers who do not receive extra pay; \r\n\r\n* 	\r\nan appeal and review procedure for teachers who are not selected for merit pay; \r\n\r\n* 	\r\neligibility for extra pay should be available to all teachers; \r\n\r\n* 	\r\nany extra payor status should not be subject to diminution; \r\n\r\n* 	\r\nevaluation plans should not be simplistic or based merely on student achievement tests, but reflect \r\n\r\n\r\nthe complexity of factors of success; \r\n* 	\r\nplans should be adopted only if they are acceptable to teachers through the collective bargaining process; \r\n\r\n* \r\nany financial rewards must be part of a plan committed to improving the conditions and pay of teachers. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of organizational responses to education reform can be demonstrated by the effects of these two divergent approaches. Predictably, the press focused a great deal of attention on NEA\'s negativism, causing teachers frequently to be painted as part of the problem, rather than part of the solution. Consequently, national NEA leaders muted their rhetoric in public statements and began to echo AFT\'s openness to a discussion of broad-ranging issues. State level activities, however, reflect the chasm between the policies of the two unions. \r\nFrom October, 1983 through January, 1984, the AFT held four regional conferences on education reform for state and local leaders. Outside experts and AFT staff and officers reviewed various reform proposals and discussed why the opportunities presented outweighed the risks accompanying them. Most leaders left with a greater understanding of the issues, the public\'s mood and sentiment, and the dependency of public education\'s future on being amenable to change. Most are now involved in proactive and cooperative dialog on school reform. AFT state affiliates in Florida and Texas, for example, have introduced their own reform agendas, both of which include career ladders for teachers. \r\nNEA state affiliates, on the other hand, have continued to resist career ladders and increased accountability, even when this jeopardized hundreds of millions of new dollars for public education. Continued efforts of the Tennessee and Arkansas Education Associations to defeat dollar-rich reform bills, rather than discuss them rationally, are cases in point. The Tennessee Education Association, for example, spent over a year in unsuccessful attempts to defeat the career ladder section of the Governor\'s Better Schools legislation. In the eleventh hour, TEA introduced its own education bill which was soundly defeated in toto in both the House and Senate \r\neducation  committees.  Newspaper  editorials  labeled  _TEA  as  \r\n\"obstructionists\"  to  reform.  Facing  overwhelming  support  \r\nof  the  career  ladder  program  from  the  Republican  Governor,  \r\n\r\nthe Democratic legislature, the business community and the public, TEA endorsed the legislation upon passage. Concentrating its negotiations and finagling on nitpicking details, TEA ignored the critical issue of reducing years required for eligibility on various steps of the career ladder. \r\nIn contrast, AFT\'s position is predicated on the belief that reformers today are sincerely l!nterested in maintaining and improving public education, unlike past critics who wanted it dismantled. We believe they are intelligent people who seek advice from the profession through reasoned dialog on the impact and effects of various strategies and proposals. We also believe negotiations involve a give and take; political considerations, therefore, were closely examined in developing \r\nthe AFT response to reform recommendations, including \"merit \r\npay. \" \r\nBoth the national Gallup Poll andÂ· subsequent state polls of public opinion on education contributed toÂ· the AFT stance. When asked whether they would be willing to pay more taxes to improve schools if asked by school officials, the response of the public was overwhelmingly no. The sa~e group asked if they would raise taxes to improve schools if accompanied by greater performance accountability, overwhelmingly answered affirmatively. The choice was simple: preserve the status quo and allow public education to continue the last decade\'s downward spiral or explore changes which might revitalize education both substantively and financially. \r\nA second, overriding political consideration was the threat of tuition tax credits, which spell the death knell for public education. President Reagan ignored the recommendations of his own education commission and outlined his personal reform program: tuition tax credits, merit pay for teachers, school prayer, and a diminished role of the federal government in education. Bolstering Reagan\'s repeated pledge to pass tuition tax credits, the u.s. Supreme Court \r\n, \r\nrecently opened wide the door when it ruled Minnesota\'s tax deductions to be constitutional. The arguments for tax deductions are essentially.the same as those for tax credits, so the possibility that tax credits would be declared unconstitutional was no longer a stumbling block to proponents. Here the choice was also simple: improve standards and quality \r\nin public schools or create a flood of public sentiment for tuition tax credits. \r\nEducationally, does the AFT believe merit pay will improve performance and help attract and retain competent people in teaching? Traditional merit pay schemes offering different compensation to two teachers having the same credentials and seniority . and performing the same tasks will not. There is no research linking merit pay to improved performance, and researchers in both business and education favor differentiated staffing and career ladders over one-dimensional, win -lose pay systems like merit pay. We are willing to experiment with career ladders that recognize outstanding performance and offer additional pay for added responsibilities. \r\nSuccess in attracting and retaining able people in teaching is much more complex, however, than merit pay.advocates would have us believe. It involves recruitment incentives; rigorous entry and certification requirements and teacher preparation programs; dramatic salary increases for all teachers, including those at the entry level; improved working conditions; adequate \r\nresources;  opportunities  for  intellectual  stimulation;  and  \r\nrecognition of  success.  \r\nRecruitment  incentives  might  include  scholarships  and  \r\nforgiveable  loans  for  those  who  agree  to  teach  four  to  six  \r\n\r\nyears in the public schools, guarantees of summer fellowships or summer employment in schools or business, sabbaticals, and tuition-free graduate study. The AFT opposes offering salary differentials to teachers in shortage areas because \r\nthese usually are from $2,000 to $6,000 amounts easily \r\nmatched by private sector employers competing for the same workers. \r\nAdmissions standards in preservice teacher education programs should be raised and the curriculum upgraded. Attracting bright people to teaching will requireÂ· a rigorous \r\ncourse  of  study in both liberal arts and  sci~nces and education.  \r\nEntry  level  tests  for  beginning  teachers  should  set  a  \r\nhigh  standard  for  teacher  recruits.  Minimum  competency  is  \r\nnot  enough.  All  beginning  teachers  should  be  tested  and  \r\n\r\nrequired to meet a standard which represents at least the average of all college graduates. \r\nInternships of up to three years should be required of beginning teachers during which they receive substantial assistance and frequent evaluation. \r\nRadical increases are needed in beginning teacher pay. This will mean entry salaries at least $6,000 to $8,000 higher than current levels. Today the average starting teacher salary is $13,000; the average starting salary in business is $17,500. This gap widens as careers progress, with the salary differential between teaching and other professions widening to $10,000 after 10 years and $20,000 after 20 years. When making a career choice, one does not have to be a math wizard to recognize the implications of the~e disparities. \r\nSalary amounts and patterns must encourage good teachers to stay in the profession. Salary schedules of 10 to 12 very small steps spread out over a decade or more in years can \r\nhardly serve this purpose. Keeping good teachers is more \r\nlikely  with  adequate  salary  schedules  of  three  to  five  years  \r\nat the most.  \r\nThe  school  environment  and  school  policies  should  be  \r\n\r\ngeared to maintaining teacher excitement and stimulation. Teachers want to teach courses that are challenging to students who are interested. At least part of the attention given to curriculum should also focus on how all teachers can have schedules, courses, retraining and enrichment opportunities that act as incentives for them to continue in the profession. \r\nSchools should take steps to improve discipline and minimize disruption but not turn teachers into pol-icemen. Discipline codes and school organization patterns should not burden teachers with responsibilities that sap their energies and divert attention away from their proper teaching role. \r\nOpportunities should be expanded for teachers to help new teachers, implement staff development programs, and create patterns of collegiality that insure ongoing professional Â·renewal. This will undoubtedly cause major revision of the current authority structure in schools and considerably alter the traditional role of the principal. The AFT favors change that would further separate administrative from educational leadership. \r\nEvaluation procedures should be improved and encompass fair and practical methods of removing incompetent teachers from the profession. These must involve due process and be based on evaluation criteria which teachers regard as objective \r\nand reasonable. \r\n, . \r\nAll of the above strategies for attracting and retaining \r\ncompetent  people  in  teaching  are  contained  in  AFT  policy  \r\nresolutions.  We  believe  they  represent  the  ideal  solution  \r\nto  this  problem.  But  the  taxpaying  public  often  believes  \r\ncareer  ladders  must  be  part  of  the  solution.  Will  the  AFT  \r\n\r\nturn down millions or billions of new education monies for school improvement and teacher salary increases by refusal to experiment with career ladders? In our view, this would represent flagrant irresponsibility both to the public education system and to the profession. Career ladders may, in fact, \r\n.prove to be a stepping stone to higher professional -status. Staffing patterns which allow teachers to remain in the classroom, yet offer substantially higher salaries for added responsibilities teachers should have been involved in all along, may also contribute significantly to improved educational quality. The professional teacher should be involved in staff and curriculum development, investigation of and experimentation with educational research, and problem-solving related to site-specific problems. If career ladders offer these opportunities to appreciable number~ of teachers, the combination of intangible rewards the excitement and challenge of the teaching/learning process and increased financial rewards may do much to stabilize the teaching force. \r\nWhile there is no question the dialog in which we are engaged is fraught with dangers, the urgent imperative to meet evolving societal needs by upgrading excellence and equity \r\nÂ·. \r\n\r\nin the schools demands bold leadership and even some risk-taking. Hopefully, successes will outweigh the inevitable failures. Organizationally, the AFT pursued its belief that the profession must grow with the times and consequently chose the road less traveled by. \r\n12 \r\n\r\n'),(5162,88,2,50,0,'The AFT Reaction to Merit Pay Proposals'),(5183,87,2,49,0,'Education Reform'),(5184,87,2,49,0,'Wages'),(5185,87,2,41,0,'A paper examining the use of student achievement test scores as  criteria for allocation of teacher merit pay'),(5186,87,2,39,0,'Ronald A.

Ultimately, it is argued, schools would be better off. Despite its logic, simplicity, and congr~ence with American values, meritÂ· pay has not won the enthusiastic support of American teachers. In fact, The press reports teachers vehemently opposing merit pay proposals in Tennnessee, Florida, and many local communities. The public, politicians, and many educational commentators are puzzled, sometimes angered by this opposition. Are teachers lazy, uncourageous, or simply unmoved by opportunities for advancement? Why would they reject a reform that piomises to benefit both them and their schools? I believe that we can better understand this opposition and the repeated failures of merit pay plans throughout the century by reviewing the priorities of teachers, the structure of their work, and the organization oftheir schools. We have learned from business that if pay incentives are to be effective, they must be adapted to fit the work, the workers, and the workplace of any particular enterprise. As they have been typically conceived, educational merit pay plans fit neither teachers, teaching, nor schools. Today as I explore these issues,. I will distinguish between merit pay, which competitively rewards teachers who \r\n1 \r\n( have the same responsibilities, and career ladder or master teacher plans, which distinguish among teachers having different responsibilities. I will speak most directly about merit pay largely because we know most about how it works --or fails to work. However, much of this analysis is applicable to any performance incentive plan. I will begin by considering the fit between merit pay, reforms and what we know about the educational enterprise. I\'d like to do this by briefly reviewing some important things we have learned through research about teachers, teaching, and schools and suggesting how they might influence the design of merit pay plans. Having noted what I consider to be the potential organizational hazards of merit pay, I will conclude with some specific recommendations for those who are currently drafting incentive pay plans for teachers. Teachers Merit pay reforms are based on a set of well-intentioned hunches about what teachers want, how teachers work, and how schools function. They assume that teachers seek competitive pay and that those who leave the profession do so because they are disenchanted with th~ standard salary scale. As one writer in the American School Board Journal recently argued: Imagine being\' an effective, hardworking teacher condemned to receive exactly the same raise as the listless, barely adequate dolt down the hall. To anyone reared on tales of Henry Ford and Horatio Alger, this wrongheadness is so glaring that merely ~eeing it officially sanctioned must be grounds for despair. \r\nReformers assume that dissatisfied, unchallenged teachers \r\n2 \r\n( \r\nare a significant part of today\'s school problems, and that such teachers would respond enthusiastically to opportunities for competitive pay. Moreover,\' the reformers assume that merit pay would attract new, more entrepreneurial individuals to teaching. \r\nThere are several important things \'that we have learned about teachers that are relevant to this discussion of merit pay. The first ,substantiated by the research of both Dan Lortie and John Goodlad, is that the majority of teachers enter teaching to teach. That is not as self-evident as it first sounds. Teachers, do not choose teaching over other occupations because of the money or the summer vacations, or even the long, leisurely lunches, but because of the kind of inherently rewarding work it offers. \r\nMoreover, Goodlad\'s extensive research about teachers tells us that when teachers quit, they do so because they are \"frustrated \'in what they wanted to do or disappointed in their own performance.\" \r\nThe seco,nd important fact is that those who teach are not well paid, and these low wages dissatisfy them. In 1981-82, the average salary of teachers with a BA was $12,769. Engineers with a comparable degree earned $22,300. Computer scientists earned $20,300. In order to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with low wages, 100 teachers in Summerville, S.c. recently lined up at the local Post Office to apply for a custodian\'s job paying $7000 more than starting teachers make in South Carolina. \r\nGoodlad found that while money was not a major reason for teachers\' entering the profession, it ranked second as a reason \r\n3 \r\nfor leaving. He speculated about this shift: \r\n( \r\nAnticipaing rewards intrinsic to the work, \r\nteachers begin with a willingness to forego \r\nhigh salaries. However, when confronted \r\nwith the frustration of these expectations, \r\nthe fact that they sometimes are paid less than \r\nthe bus drivers who bring their students to school \r\nmay become a considerable source of \r\ndissatisfaction as well. \r\nRepeated sociological studies have shown that teachers are a conservative lot--politically, personally, and professionally. They are not financial entrepreneurs, but ratner seek financial security from predictable salaries and retirement settlements. Their dissatisfaction with pay centers on low annual wages rather than on the standard salary scale. \r\nThird, although teachers are isolated by the egg-carton structure of most schools, they regard themselves as team \r\nc 	players rather than free agents. As teacher negotiations often demonstrate, egalitarian norms are strong among teachers. In my own research, I have been struck by the intensity of teachers\' concern for equity and fair treatment. They are wary of administrative power and the potential for patronage and favoritism in assignments, promotions, and merit bonuses. \r\nGiven what we know about teachers\' preferences, priorities, and group norms, there is little to indicate that individualized merit pay would motivate them to work harder or better. Teachers want appreciation and recognition for their work, but not at other teachers\' expense. They seek better wages, but do not want to purposefully pursue them by teaching to the test or feigning compliance with administrative preferences. \r\n( \r\nBecause most merit pay plans in education are directed toward a small number of outstanding teachers, there is little reason to expect that they will raise the general level of teaching in schools. Many argue that under merit pay, outstanding teachers will continue to succeed as they always have, while the average or below average teachers, who regard merit pay as unattainable, may even reduce their efforts in discouragement. \r\nMerit pay is ostensibly an incentive for improved performance. But as it is being proposed by many school critics and legislators, merit pay is a stick disguised as a carrot. It will punish those who fail more than it will motivate and reward those who succeed. \r\n( TEACHING Next, I want to mention a few things we have learned about teaching--the labor of this schooling enterprise--that have implications for the merit pay plans. \r\nFirst, despite 80 years of effort, educational researchers have failed to identify the characteristics of effective teachers or effective teaching. What is clear is that there are many different styles of good ,teaching, and that it is difficult to separate teaching expertise from the individual. Although welders and salesmen undoubtedly encounter uncertainty and exercise discretion in their work, they do know what success is--a good weld, a final sale--and they know when they have achieved it. This is often not true for teachers, or for the evaluators who assess their work. \r\nSecond, teaching is what my colleague, David Cohen, calls \r\n( an \"indeterminate practice.\" Because schools do not define their goals carefully and often pursue many objectives simultaneously, expectations for teachers are often vague, muddled, or conflicting. They are expected to teach reading, handwriting, exposition, social adjustment, inferential reasoning, and more. There are no generally accepted strategies for achieving those outcomes that are made explicit. Moreover, teachers must constantly adjust to the uneven and unpredictable development of students, who ea~h bring a unique set of strengths, weaknesses, and past experiences.Â· There are no true raw materials in teaching. Third, although teaching is carried out in isolated classrooms, it is an interdependent process. Teachers must rely on those who instruct other grades or subject levels to do their work well so that the final product of this educational assembly line is a well-educated student. Moreover, teachers must constantly cooperate with other staff and adjust their teaching practices to larger program or school goals. Teaching, then, is an underdefined craft. In most schools, teachers must contend with unspecified, but all encompassing goals as they seek to teach students with varied capabilities, skills, and patterns of growth. Teachers work alone, but their work is successiver no single individual finishes the job. Merit pay plans assumes that there is general agreement about what good teaching is and what it should accomplish. There is in fact no such consensus. Moreover, merit pay assumes that the individual teacher\'s accomplishments can be isolated and assesJed. Yet because of the successive and interactive nature \r\n6 \r\nof schooling it seems unlikely that various teachers\' \r\n( \r\neffectiveness can be compared with any precision. Teachers know \r\nthat in their work they must tolerate considerable uncertainty \r\nand ambiguity about their success. If the product of schooling is \r\na well-educated student, individual teachers control only a \r\npiece of that product. However, merit pay plans assess each year \r\nof the teacher\'s work as if it were the entire production process \r\nor as if the pieces of that process were simply additive. \r\nTeachers can neither control the quality or preparedness of the \r\nstudents they teach; nor can they accurately predict or regulate \r\nthe uneven developmental rates of student learning. A secondâ€¢\r\ngrade teacher\'s success in laying the groundwork of mathematical \r\nreasoning may not become apparent until her students reach the \r\nfifth grade; the change that the teacher will then be credited \r\nwith the success is slim. Conversely, students who perform \r\nsatisfactorily in first-year French may begin to fall behind in \r\nthe second year because they never really learned the irregular \r\nverbs in the introductory course. Test scores will never reveal \r\nthe source of the probl~m. For these reasons, teachers recognize \r\nthat their work is interdependent, though often isolated. As \r\nindividuals, they can influence but not control the outcome. \r\nSchools \r\nSchools, too, have important features that reformers must take into account as they design merit pay plans. Performanceâ€¢based pay systems assume a hierarchical relationship between supervisor and supervisee. The principal, assumedly having superior expertise, can assess teachers\' performance from the \r\n7 \r\n( \r\n\r\ndistance of his or her formal position. However, schools have both a formal and informal structure. The formal structure, which is apparent on the organization chart, is hierarchical, bureaucratic, and rulebound. The principal is in charge; the teachers are subordinate. The informal structure is flat, reciprocal, and highly dependent on personal relationships. There is extensive overlap between teachers\' and administrators\' responsibi1ities,interests and concerns. \r\nAlthough principals are technically the instr\'ll;ctional leaders of the school, many readily admit that their teachers are the experts at the craft of teaching. Many principals who have never taught at the level where they administer turn their attention to school management rather than classroom supervision. They leave the teaching to. the teachers. They are different from the industrial foreman or the unit head in business who con~inua1ly oversee and inspect their supervisees\' work. \r\nAlthough principals have formal authority for the school, its staff, and program, they must rely on the cooperation of teachers to make their schools run well. As one principal I interviewed ~xp1ained: \r\nA principal can\'t be strictly management and run a good school. I need the teachers\' help and advice. I can\'t make decisions in \r\n. a vacuum. I have to maintain a certain level of trust if I expect the school to function well. (HER 1980,p. 224) \r\nIn their effort to\' foster reciprocal relationships and collegiality with staff, principals o.ften assume positions somewhere between teachers and managers, facilitating effective instruction. They support and protect their teachers, \r\n8 \r\n( 	they moderate conflict, and they minimize competition. They respect, or at least acknowledge, teachers\' concern for equity and take steps to eliminate, or at least conceal, favoritism. They intuitively recognize that if they were to formalize their relationship with their staff, they would pay an organizational \r\n. price. Relationships might well become strained; administration would certainly become more difficult; the school might run less well. \r\nEffective schools--those schools where students consistently outperform predicted levels of success--are notable for their consistent focus and purp.ose. In such schools, administrators and staff acknowledge their interdependence in setting schoolwide goals. Teachers plan cooperatively, and work \r\n( collegially. As Stewart Purkey and Marshall Smith observe, \"An academically effective school is distinguished by its culture: a structure, process, and climate of values and norms that channel staff and students. in the direction of successful teaching and learning.\" Our limited understanding of effective schools suggests that serious efforts should be made by school reformers to promote reciprocity between teachers and administrators, and to increase teachers\' interdependence and cooperation. Most merit pay plans, however, would have the opposite effect. They would likely isolate rather than integrate the individual teacher. If teachers were competing for scarce rewards, they would be less likely to share their ideas and materials with colleagues. If merit pay incentives encouraged teachers to work on their own \r\nbehalf rather than on behalf of the entire school, students of \r\n( \r\nexemplary teachers might profit at the expense of students in other classrooms. The quality of curriculum development, building supervision, and inservice training might all be diminished by merit pay plans that stress the accomplishments of the individual over the accomplishments of the group. \r\nThe Hazards of Merit Pay \r\nFrom the perspective of teachers, teaching, and schools, merit pay plans, as they are typically designed, have little promise for motivating teachers, improving schools, and creating working conditions that would attract talented new staff. Moreover, there are a number of oiganizational hazards to beware of if you are innstituting merit pay for teachers, and I would \r\n( like to summarize those now before moving on to some specific recommendations. 1 â€¢. Merit pay may generate divisive competition among staff and ultimately divert teachers\' attention from teaching.The line between healthy and unhealthy competition is a fine one that warrants careful watching. \r\n2. \r\nIf merit pay bonuses are restricted to . only a few teachers, the entÂ·ire staff may reject the initiative as an empty symbolic gesture or ostracize the individuals who are selected for recognition. \r\n\r\n3. \r\nMerit pay may actually serve as a disincentive for average and below-average teachers who regard performance bonuses as unattainable . \r\n\r\n\r\n10 \r\n4. Administrators who have unrealistic expecations about the \r\n( efficacy of merit pay to improve teaching may neglect other \r\n\\ \r\nimportant means of motivating and improving staff. \r\n5. \r\nMerit pay may promote \"gaming\" among teachers by redirecting their attention from their instruction to their ratings. This has proven to be an ~nintended consequence of merit pay reforms in the civil service. Those teachers who are intent on achieving high merit ratings will focus their efforts on that challenge. In some cases, that will lead to better teaching; in many it will not. \r\n\r\n6. \r\nBy promoting independence rather than interdependence, merit pay may increase teacher isolation i~ schools. Distrust about evaluations and suspicions about patronage may reduce cooperation among teachers as well as between teachers and principals. Such organizational disruption may well interfere with efforts to improve schools. \r\n\r\n\r\nRecommendations for Merit Pay Design \r\nLest you think that my entire perspective is \'one of gloom and doom, I would like to conclude with some specific, hopefully constructive recommendations for those of you who will be instituting merit pay in your states or local districts. \r\n1. Do thorough plarining and organizational preparation for any reform of teachers\' pay and responsibilities. That means meeting and talking wi~h teachers, soliciting their ideas, and \r\n. taking those ideas seriously. It means listening to principals\' concerns and involving them in the design of what they must administer. It means negotiating an incentive system that all \r\n11 \r\n\r\nÂ· segments of the school community believe can work and are willing to \r\nmake work. \r\n2. \r\nRecognize that merit pay is not a cost-saving reform. It cannot substitute for good salaries and it should only be instituted as an extra incentive. Merit pay will not yield a big return on a small investment, particularly if teachers regard it as a way for school officials to avoid paying adequate wages. \r\n\r\n3. \r\nDesign your plan so that its emphasis is positive, not punitive, so that the focus is on recognizing good teaching rather than eradicating bad teaching. If merit pay is really a stick rather than a carrot, it will not serve as an incentive for \r\n\r\n\r\nimprovement~ \r\n4. As counterintuitive as it may seem, consider deemphasizing the monetary component of merit pay, especially if \r\n~ \r\nthere is little funding available for the program. Experiemnt \r\nwith symbolic rewards. Or recognize outstanding teachers not with \r\nbonuses in their pay envelopes, but with credit lines to be used \r\nfor ordering special curricular materials, buying consultants\' \r\ntime, or attending conference. Honor teachers by granting them \r\ndiscretion over instructional purchases and you may find that \r\nyou have a genuine performance incentive. \r\nS.If you institute an individualized merit pay plan, spend the money and time necessary to have a thorough, creditable evaluation system. We have learned from industry that if employees believe that pay and performance are not tig~tly linked, merit pay will not work. Therefore, you should commit \r\n12 \r\n( \r\n\r\n~ \r\n/ \r\nr \r\n. 	yourselves to defining clear performance criteria, training evaluators to achieve rater reliability, requiring multiple observations, and, if possible, multiple evaluators. Short cuts will, in the end, prove costly. \r\n6.Couple any performance appraisal system with ongoing inservice training and individual remediation. It\'s possible that merit pay might motivate some teachers to work harder, but it won\'t improve the performance of mediocre teachers who don\'t know how to change and probably will not choose to leave. \r\n7. \r\nUse test scores cautiously. There will be great pressure for objective measures and increased accountability. Test scores are currently the only comparative measure of instructional outcomes readily available in most school districts. But test scores are problematic. They measure only part of what is taught They do not assess creative expression, scientific reasoning, or citizenship. Moreover, some students do not test well, while thers test far beyond their routine performance. In determining merit awards, use test scores only with reference to an entire school\'s progress, never in reference to the success of an individual teacher. When tests they are used for schoolwide comparisons, be sure to include qualitative measures of effectiveness as well. \r\n\r\n8. \r\nStructure merit pay plans so that there is frequent opportunity for success by many teachers. They need not be annual awards conveyed on a small number of people. Set districtwide or schoolwide goals and reward all who achieve them, not simply the select few who do the very best. In In Search of \r\n\r\n\r\n13 \r\n\r\nExcellence,  Peters and Waterman describe excellent companies  as  \r\n(  those  that  \"turn  the  average Joe and  the  average  Jane  into  \r\nwinners.  They let,  even  insist that,  people stick out.  They  \r\naccentuate  the  positive.\"  We  need  more  winners  and  would-be  \r\nwinners  in schools.  \r\n9.  Design your  merit pay plans  so  that they promote teacher  \r\ninterdependence rather th\"an  isolation.  Reward  teams  of  teachers,  \r\ndepartments,  or  schools  rather than singling out  individuals.  If  \r\nthere  is peer pressure,  let it be  on  behalf of the group.  \r\n10.  Finally, recognize  that incentive plans require ongoing  \r\ntending,  realigning,  and  refurbishing.  Ip schools,  as  in all  \r\norganizations,  entropy reigns.  Even  the best-designed merit pay  \r\nsystem  or  career  ladder will become  stale and  ineffective  unless  \r\n/\" \\  it is flexible,  regularly reviewed,  and revived.  \r\nIn closing,  I  would  like  to  remind you that  we  live,  as  Jay  \r\nFeatherstone says,  in the United States of Amnesia.  Merit  pay  \r\nfor  teachers  is  not  a  new  idea.  It has been tried at many  times,  \r\nin  many  places,  and with few  exceptions,  it has  failed.  If  \r\n/â€¢ school  reformers  dismiss  or  disregard those failures,  they  will  \r\nlikely repeat them.  In the process,  money will be  lost,  teachers  \r\nwill be disaffected,  and children  will pay the price.  \r\nMany  of you  are  under pressure  to  institute merit pay  as  a  \r\ncondition  of  increased  financial  support  by  business  and  \r\ngovernment.  If you decide  to  institute merit pay reforms,  I  urge  \r\nyou  to  design plans  that  are  consistent with who  teachers  are  and  \r\nwhat  matters  to  them,  plans  that acknowledge  the complexity  of  \r\nteaching and  the difficulty of assessing it,  plans  that  support  \r\n14  \r\n\r\nmore coherent, cooperative school organizations, plans that, in the end, will have been worth your time and energy_\r\nc. \r\n'),(5221,85,2,49,0,'Education Reform'),(5222,85,2,49,0,'Wages'),(5223,85,2,41,0,'A transcript from Meet the Press'),(5224,85,2,39,0,'AFT'),(5225,85,2,48,0,'NBC News,.

KALB: A new Gallup poll out today shows that Americans \'i \r\nconfidence in their public schools and teachers, even in their willingness to pay more taxes for public education, has gone up dramatically in the past year. Our guests today have strong views on the sUbject. \r\nGov~rnot Charles Robb of Virginia, a moderate Democrat who yesterday became Chairman of the Education Commission of the states, and Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers, whose membership exceeds a half-million, making it the second largest union of American teachers. \r\nOur reporters today are Haynes Johnson of ~Washington ~, Edward B. Fiske \'of ~~York Times, Lucia Solorzano of \r\nU. S. News & World Report. and to open the questioning, our regular panelist, Bill Monroe, of NBC News. \r\nMR. MONROE: Governor Robb, we do want to deal with educaâ€¢tion, but I have to ask you first about the Mecklenburg Prison situation. I understand you stayed up all night, or most of it, dealing \"lith it. At that prison some inmates took over one section of a building, seized nine hostages, and injured two of them. Is that situation now over? Is it under control? \r\nGOV. , ROBB: Fortunately, that situation has been resolved. ~1e established Cl deadline at 7:00 a .m. this morning for release of all the hostages and the inmates who were in control of the second floor of one of the buildings complied with that deadline. The\' hostages have been referred to a local hospital. I am informed that there are no. serious permanent injuries. There are a couple \r\nof puncture wounds, several other abrasions, but nothing that looks like it will be permanent in nature. \r\nMR. fÂ·tONROE: Those inmates made something like 14 demands, including an end to what they feel was brutal treatment by the guards, dismissal of the warden, better meals -did State officials give in to any of those demands? \r\nGOV. ROBB: No, there was no giving in to any of the demands. As a matter of fact, there were some additional demands that were made later on in the process. We indicated that it was necessary to get the hostages out. There Was never any real risk of danger outâ€¢side of the prison walls, clearly there was to the hostages that were involved. Two of them that were stabbed in the original takeâ€¢over were released initially, one additional guard that had diffiâ€¢culty with a medical condition was released during the night, so the last six were released this morning. \r\nMR. t-10NROE: One more question on that subject, are you due for some basic reform at that prison? You\'ve had tremendous amount of trouble there in the last couple of months. You\'ve had death row inmates escaping, a fight between guards and inmates -â€¢\r\nGOV. ROBB: This is largely a reaction to some of the reform that is taking place at this time. A new warden has been installed, new senior corrections officials are in place at the facility. l-1ost of the demands, if you \\flill look at them, are really a reaction to tightened procedures at the prison itself, and it is a relatively predictable situation when any new management comes in and when new procedures are established, but we will continue to look at the \r\nsituation, investigation is ongoing at this time. \r\nMR. r~NROE: Mr. Shanker, the new Gallup poll which Mr. Kalb referred to showing the public much more favorable to public schools, is the public in touch with reality? Is there any reason why they should be more favorable to public schools now than they were a year ago? Is something happening that\'s good in the public schools? \r\nMR. SHANKER: Well, I think clearly the public schools have not changed that much in one year. You can\'t change that much in an institution of this size, but what the public sees is very real. It sees that there are 50 governors, 50 state legislatures, members of the business community nationally and at the state level, teacher organizations, they see a tremendous a~Dunt of interest, they see piles of new legislation. They see a tightening up. ~hey see reâ€¢quirements for teachers being tested, for students in terms of proâ€¢motion and graduation. Requirements in courses, additional money being put into schools. States mandating substantial increases in minimum salaries to attract more talented youngsters. So I think what they see is that attention is being paid, and that changes are being legislated. I\'m not sure that the public is aware of the fact that when you pass a law things -it\'s not like pressing a button. That these reforms will take years before there is real payoff. \r\nMR. KALB: Thank you, gentlemen. We\'ll be back with more questions for Governor Robb and Albert Shanker. \r\n(Announcements) \r\nMR. KALB: Our guests on MEET THE PRESS, Governor Charles \r\nRobb of Virginia, and Albert Shanker of the American Federation of \r\ni ~ . \r\nTeachers. t\'1e\' 11 resume the questioning with Ms. Solorzano. \r\nMS. SOLORZANO: Mr. Shanker, two-thirds of the adults in the recent Gallup poll said that they think high school students don\'t \",ork hard enough. They don\'t do enough home\'\'I1ork, they\'re not chalâ€¢lenged enough by their schoolwork. ~lliy has it been so difficult to make school more challenging to students? \r\nMR. SHANKER: Well, I think that we have to remember that what we\'re doing now in bringing in these new reforms is we\'re changâ€¢ing a previous bunch of reforms. If you go back to the late 1960s, I\'m sure somebody appeared on this show who said that schools were too tyrannical, that we were requiring students to do too much, that the materials were irrelevant, that the kids shouldn\'t be reading Shakespeare anymore, that whatever a child wants to do is good for him and we should let them do what they want, and that a teacher should be more like a travel agent selling tickets to a kid who is going on his own way rather than a teacher cramming things down his throat. So actually, the public got what it wanted during that period, and it went too far the other way. It created a system that was too loose. Now of course these new course requirements will require a good deal of homework, and that\'s good. \r\nMS. SOLORZANO: But couldn\'t teachers all along have decided to give more homework if they believed the old policies had flaws? \r\nMR. SHANKER: No, they couldn\'t. The policies are set by states, they\'re set by boards of education, they\'re implemented by superintendents and principals. t~en I was a teacher, if I was in a school and I required tough standards and decided not to pass a \r\nlarge number of students because they didn\'t meet those standards \r\nI was in trouble. I could be rated unsatisfactory for being tough, and furthermore, the principal of the school did actually come in and change some of my failing grades to passing grades, because he said you\'re ncting against the policy of the schools. ~10st teachers were against this softening all along. \r\nMR. KALB: Mr. Fiske? \r\nMR. FISKE: Mr. Shanker, as you mentioned before, the legisâ€¢\r\nlatures and governors in virtually every state over the last year or two have enacted reforms aimed at improving schools. Political bodies don\'t normally stick money and political prestige on the line without asking also for more control. Do you expect that one of the consequences of all of this concern with educational reform will be a shift of power away from the local school boards and to the atate capitols? \r\nMR. SHANKER: Well, you have it already to a certain extent. I\'m sure that the school boards in California, for instance, are complaining that that ISO-page piece of legislation means that they are told which text books to select, which teachers they can and cannot hire, how many minutes of the day h~ve to be spent on this subject andcthat subject -I think it\'s unfortunate, and I hope it\'s temporary, but t think it was necessary_ I think that there was no other way to tighten up things quickly except for states to move in and to regulate. I also think that in passing all that legislation I think we\'re sending an unfortunate message to future teachers. The bright kids who are in college or high school right now, they \r\nr 	notice that nobody is passing laws telling doctors what to do, or lawyers what to do or dentists what to do, theylre going to say somebody must think that teachers are just awful. These states are just busy every day passing laws telling them \'\'\'hich books to use and what methods to use and everything else. I think that once welve tightened up, which we\'re just about completed with now, that we ought to move on to give local people, and I think the professionâ€¢als especially, more decision-making power. Othe~lise, you\'re not going to get talented people to corne into a field where everything is legislated. \r\nMR. FISKE: Governor Robb, do you as you look at your own state, and as you talk to your colleagues around the country, do you see this kino of a shift of power toward the state government as opposed to the local governments in controlling schools? \r\nGOV. ROBB: To a certain extent there is at this time, but I think inevitably the power, as you describe it, is always going to follow the ~~ney, and where the money is raised, and it\'s a basic question of federalism here, it\'s one of the things that the Educaâ€¢tion Commission of the States is looking at and trying to assess the appropriate level. I think everyone agrees that as much control as you can vest in local jurisdictions, local school boards, you Ire always going to be better served. But if the Congress of the United States appropriates a great deal of money inevitably there are going to be strings attached to it. The same is going to be true at the state level. \r\nMR â€¢.KALB: Mr. Johnson? \r\n... \r\nJ \' â€¢ \r\nalthough they have real reservations about it, they are participating in the dialogue with the rest of those who are concerned about enhuncâ€¢ing the educational prospects and improving our commitment to excellâ€¢ence. \r\nMR~ KALB: Governor, you\'re a Democrat, and Mr. Shanker, your union has come out for a Mondale victory. The President says he\'s putting more money into education than has ever been put in before. Hhat\'s wrong ~1ith the Reagan program, in your view, Governor? \r\nGOV. ROBB: Oh, I\'m sorry -as far as I\'m concerned, the proâ€¢gram in education is perhaps not the area where we have the biggest difference. I think the commitment to taxes, as Mr. Johnson indicated earlier, it\'s a matter of candor, and the same poll\'that was referred to indicated that even though in that poll Mr. Reagan ,,,,as preferred generally, they felt that Mr. Mondale would do a better job of enâ€¢hancing education, and I think it\'s simply because of the fact that there is a commitment to fund education. I don\'t think they\'re making distinctions in terms of which level is most appropriate for the funding. I\'d have to concede that there\'s an open question uS to whether or not the federal government ought to be the principal player in terms of funding. Clearly, the federal government has to protect access, it has to provide for special populations, it has to provide for certain types of basic research. I happen to believe, as many other governors believe, however, that we ought to focus on the states and the local levels for most of the major increases in funding that are coming forth. \r\nMR. KALB: Okay. But in your view, what\'s wrong with the \r\nReagan program on education? \r\nMR. SHANKER: Well, the main Reagan program, unfortunately, hasn\'t been able to get through, and that\'s to provide tuition tax credits for students, and that would mean that public schools -it would mean essentially that partnts who can now already afford to send their children to non-public schools would be given tax monies, and he proposed that that monies be shifted away from students who already -poor students mainly, and minority students who are already in the public schools. I think that\'s -I think it would be extremely destructive of public education, and I think we would end up ultimateâ€¢ly with the problems of Quebec and other places with Catholic schools, Jewish schools, Protestant schools, Communist schools, Ku-Klux Klan schools, .Mexican-American --the whole function of our public school system to pull our country together would be destroyed in that sort of system. I think that for a conservative he is being.extremely radical in terms of his major school program. \r\nrÂ·m. KALB: r1r. Monroe? \r\nMR. MONROE: Governor, what about Mr. Mondale\'s $11 billion federal program for education? That would presumably mean taxes, presumably from what you and Mr. Shanker have just said, it would enhance federal control -are you in favor of that? \r\nGOV. ROBD: Well, let me say that there are sorne philosophical differences, but the basic commitment to education is sound, and I think that\'s reflected in the attitude of the poll that you were disâ€¢cussing earlier. The American people want to see more resources put into education. They want to see a commitment to excellence. We may differ as to exactly where that funding ought to be lodged, but I think \r\nthe commitment is what the American people are looking for, and as I \r\nhave said previously, I think it is clear that Mr. Mondale has been very candid in acknowledging that you cannot achieve this excellence \r\nand fund the other programs, and reduce the deficit without so~~ inâ€¢crease in taxes, in addition to more controlled spending in the defense area, some question of the whole entitlement program, the means test, is going to have to be examined carefully, and all of these are politically -political no-noes at this point, but they\'re going to have to do it on the table and address. \r\n(Continued on next page) \r\nl2 MR. MONROE: Since you passed by the opportunity to endorse Mr. Mondale\'s $11 billion program in specific terms, I gather you are not in favor of it? GOV. ROOD: I haven\'t had an opportunity to review the speciâ€¢fics of his program, but again, I come from --from the view of many of the states that are willing to bite that bullet themselves, and are not looking to the Federal Government for the kinds of increased fundâ€¢ing that I know many of the American people think ought to come from someplace, and the Federal Government seems to have the deepest pocket. MR. KALD: Ms. Solorzano. MS. SOLORZANO: We\'ve talked here and much of the action has centered on rewarding superior performance in the classroom, merit pay. Governor Robb, what kinds of actions are being taken on the opposite end, removing teachers from the classroom who may be incompetent or may just not be doing a good job? GOV. RODD: Well, there have always been some vehicles for removing teachers, and certainly the process of teacher certification and the --the concept now of recertification in the basic skills will continue, and the concept of merit pay really isn\'t designed to addressed that component equation. MS. SOLORZANO: Dut are states beginning to look at the problem of tenured teachers who may not be doing an adequate job and yet are kept in the classroom? GOV. RODD: States have done that. One of --one of the advantages, and I\'m almost contradicting myself here, but to suggest that providing special incentives and rewards for exceptional perforâ€¢mance, you tend to leave behind, at the very least, those who are \r\nÂ· ...\r\n_..l \r\nmarginally acceptable, those who clearly don\'t meet standards. There \r\nare procedures in most states for riading the system of those who are clearly i.competent, but we\'re talking about enhancing the entire profession, and you will stretch out the --the entire spectrum of teacher quality with any program that\'s designed to recognize that added benefit. \r\n~ffi. KALD: Mr. Fiske. \r\nMR. FISKE: Mr. Shanker, you mentioned earlier that one of -â€¢\r\n, \r\none of the pereanial problems about improving the schools is the quality of new recruits to the teaching force. It\'s well known that teaching _. education students tend to have lower SAT scores than stUdents in most other fields. other than higher salaries, what --what can be done to get more talented people into the teaching profession? \r\nMR. SHANKER: Well, I think other than higher salaries, I think you have several issues. One is that until we solve some of the extreme discipline problems, which was the number one concern on this poll of the --of the American people in terms of conditions, you\'re not going to get somebody who loves Shakespeare or who\'s roally good at math or science to, first, make the financial sacrifice, and then be locked in a room where essentially that person is a prison guard or a policeman handling very disturbed children. So that problem has to be take\'n care of. \r\nSecondly, there\'s the problem of those children who weren\'t reached early enough in the first few grades, and as you have a high school teacher who wants to teach these subjects, but is faced with children who are still counting on their fingers or who are illiterate. \r\nThat person didn\'t become a nursery school or a first or second-year \r\nteacher. So I think that\'s it, but I think that we oughtt:o tap two groups of people that we haven\'t tapped before. There may be millions of people out there who are willing to teach for a few years, but who are not willing to devote an entire lifetime to it. I think that we ought to offer to pay for a person\'s college if they teach for five years, provided that they are outstanding students, and the second grade pool is to go to retirees, people in industry who are retiring at 50 and 55 years of age, many of them with one year of additional training could be teachers for another 10 or 15 years and could do a great job. \r\nMR. FISKE: One of the things that you --complaints that you hear, especially from governors and members of State Doards of Educaâ€¢tion is, that whenever people come up with an idea of that sort, they buck up against the Unions. In New Jersey, Governor Kean has a propoâ€¢sal to --to get liberal arts graduates into the teachingprdfession to --to smooth the way and make it a little easier. Now, what --are you contradicting yourself, that the Unions tends to oppose this or \r\nMR. SHANKER: No, not at all. I like Governor Kean\'s idea, in terms of getting liberal arts graduates. I don\'t like the idea that a person could become a permanent teacher without knowing anything about child behavior, without knowing anything about the issues in education. Let the pe~son come in. Let the person even start teaching, but within a year, or two or three years, there\'s nothing wrong with saying that that person ought to also know something about his own. profession, or her own profession and field. I feel that what he\'s doing is \'not strengtheningÂ·but watering down. \r\nMR. KALD: Governor Robb, did you want to add something? \r\nGOVERNOR RODD: I just wanted to say we have a program like the one you described\' in Virginia right now that was put into place about two years ago, where a liberal arts graduate, not a graduate of a teacher college or what have you, comes into the progr~within the first two years they have to take three courses that baeically deal with pedagogy, but we have found that it is beginning to stimulate additional interest, brings in a whole pool of new talent, and I agree with Mr. Shanker, that there are a number of other sources of talent that simply haven\'t been adequately tapped as yet. \r\nMR. RALD: You\'ve got about two minutes to go. Mr. Johnson. \r\nMR. JOHNSON: Governor Robb, the Gallup Poll says that disciâ€¢pline remains the greatest concern among the American public when it comes to education. You\'ve had that problem today with your problems \r\n\\ \r\nwith prisons, but how do you address that problem? People are conâ€¢cerned about discipline in the schools. \r\nGOV. RODD: Well, for the most part, it starts at home, and we have to --I think the whole increased emphasis on education is healthy, because it is creating awareness of the problem from stem to stern, if you will, and discipline has to begin at home, and it has to be reinforced, and if there is no discipline in the home, it\'s going to be very difficult for a teacher to exact and expect the kind of discipline that most of us would regard as appropriate for classroom behavior. \r\nMR. JOHNSON: And Mr. Shanker, from the teacher\'s standpoint in the classroom, should they have more power to exercise discipline? MR. SHANKER: I think the school needs more power to remove the student who is consistently and --disruptive, not just on one day \r\n\'.. \r\nIJ \r\nor with one teacher, or during one tough period of time, but the student who can\'t get along with anybody, and who\'s preventing everyâ€¢body else from learning, it\'s not nice and it\'s difficult to do, a tough decision, but if we can\'t remove that student and allow the others to learn, the American people will take their children out of public schools and demand private schools, because that\'s the biggest differenae between a private and a public school. The private school doesn\'t take that child, or if they have them, they just throw them out. We\'ve got to educate everybody, but the first thing is, we ought to guarantee the safety and education of the overwhelming majority who want to learn. \r\nMR. KALD: Less than a minute. Mr. Monroe. \r\nMR. MONROE: Governor Robb, a political question. You originally were for John Glenn for the Democratic nomination, and now that you have watched the Mondale-Ferraro ticket operate for about two weeks since the Democratic Convention, do you have a feeling it has any chance in Virginia? \r\nGOV. RODD: Virginia, admittedly, is going to be one of the tougher states, but I think the --the team or the ticket does have a real chance. I think that the addition of Geraldine Ferraro to the ticket adds a dimension that is exciting for most of the American public. I think that the issues that they are focusing on now are going to bring more of the main stream back to support the ticket, and I \r\napplaud the candor of the ticket in telling the American people truthfully some of the hard choices that they face in the next four years. I hope that that kind of candor can be encouraged by success in November. \r\nMR.

On the other hand, all the reports do call for large inâ€¢creases in teacher salaries, and these are reports written by \r\n, buSiness leaders and state officials, not teacher unions, he \r\n-j \r\nadded. While most of the reports also contain items that the AFT \r\nhas traditionally opposed, such as merit pay, the difference beâ€¢tween these reports and previous ones is that they are offered in the spirit of cooperation, with a true desire for positive Change, Shanker said. \r\n\"It would be a terrible mistake to criticize these reports,\" Shanker added. It would confirm the feeling that public educaâ€¢tion is a massive institution totally resistant to change-and would cause an outpouring of support and funds away from public schools and toward private schools. The NEA has made the mistake of categorically dismissing these new proposals, but the AFT executive council supported Shanker in a move to study these ideas and help improve education and the lot of teachers. \r\n\"Education in this country is now ina AFr Must Be situation not much different than that of Willing To the automobile and steel industries 10 Consider Cbanges years ago: we can see all kinds of things \r\ncoming,\" Shanker said. While these two industries knew what was happening in the international market they did not take action, and now they may be on the way toward extinction. If public education is not to go the same way, it must agree to change, Shanker said. \r\nAs a first step in this new dialogue, Shanker invited Educaâ€¢tion Secretary Terrel Bell to meet with the council in an offâ€¢the-record session to talk about areas of agreement on the reports. \r\nThe AFT will also set upa series of regional conferences and retreats for teachers and policymakers to discuss some of . the new proposals. In addition, this year\'s AFT convention will serve as a forum for some of the leading thinkers in this area. Over the next year, AFT will develop its own plan of action to improve public education. \r\nIf the AFT refused to cooperate in this dialogue, teachers may have certain changes thrust upon them unilaterally, Shanker said. The AFT must be willing to discuss all proâ€¢posals, including merit pay, he added. The union has had very good reasons for opposing merit pay and some master teacher plans over the years, but some of the new proposals are resolving some of the objections, Shanker said. \r\nA proposal by Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, for example, calls for merit review, but the evaluation would be made bya state commission whose members would include teachers selected by teacher organizations, Shanker said. And whereas most merit plans provide for only a few teathers to get pay increases, in Tennessee 30 to 60 percent of all teachers would be eligible for the raise, Shanker said. \r\nTeachers in Tennessee would be given additional responâ€¢sibilities, such as overseeing student teachers and developing the curriculum, along with the additional pay. This could proâ€¢vide a ladder of advancement for teachers who would develop new skills while remaining in the classroom. And as teachers take on new jobs, the role of the principal and assistant prinâ€¢cipal could be modified. \' \r\n\"The factory relationship in the school could very well ,change ,and a new type of profeSSional status for teachers could develop,\" Shanker said. The AFT is providing input to decision-makers in Tennessee as the plan is being developed. \r\nThe executive council spent several hours discussing some of these new plans and their implications for teachers and the union. They agreed that this is a time of tremendous opporâ€¢tunity for increasing teacher salaries since public interest is focused on education. While some of the plans pose certain risks for teacher unionists, great gains sometimes require great risks, several AFT vice presidents commented during the meeting. \r\nIn summing up, Shanker said that public education currently requires $20 to $40 billion in new funds if some of the imâ€¢provements called for by the various reports are to be made. \"If you can\'t get an infusion without strings attached, the question is whether you believe in the institution strongly enough to pay the price,\" he said. \r\nIronically, the day after the union made  \r\nReagan Renews  these apparent goodwill gestU(es toward  \r\nAttacks Despite  the administration, President Reagan  \r\nThese Overtures  delivered yet another stinging attack on  \r\npublic schools and teachers. In his  \r\n\r\nspeech at graduation ceremonies at Seton Hall University in \r\nNew Jersey, the president again made his pitch for tuition tax \r\ncredits and criticized \"the heaviest hitters in the national . education lobby\" for opposing pay. and\' promotions on the \r\nbasis of merit and competence. \r\n\"Constructive criticism is one thing,\" Shanker com,mented, but the president\'s comments \"serve one purpose-and that is directly contributing to an already low level of self-esteem by teachers.\" \r\n, ,\",\"\'., .. ,\'\". ,\". ,.; \',.:\'-:\'; \'-\'->:~ .. ~\", \" -:<\".; ., ~\" \r\n.

Comments of teachers between sessions were a testimonial to the rewards of the teacher center program gleaned through your tireless efforts. \r\nIn my session, we discussed the need for involving the membership more directly in protecting educational standards, seeking input to decision-making on these issues, and promoting community outreach. Too often the. union is perceived as handling safety/security issues, but not being involved in \r\n\" \r\nmembers\' day-to-day instructional needs. \r\nI have proposed a program which would be complementary to the teacher center, which I\'d like to discuss with you and Bill. \r\nFirst, the problem. As budget cuts increase and conditions worsen in the schools, teachers and paraprofessionals often become resigned to condiâ€¢tions which are not conducive to learning. Too much paperwork, increasing discipline problems, supply shortages, conflicting Board directives and so forth present obstacles to teaching. People start out fighting to preserve good teaching/learning environments, but sometimes get tired of knocking their head against the wall and decide this is just the way the system is. This leads to the \"survival syndrome,\" whereby people are concerned with coping on a day-to-day basis in their classrooms. We find this blurs global issues in education and leaves members with a sense that nobody really cares what\'s going on in their classrooms. \r\nFortunately, the union-supported teaGher center fills this void in many of our locals. But I think there\'s even more ,ve can do. \r\nWe would like to do some experimental work combining two separate programs originating in Corpus Christi and New York City. The idea is to have a new union position in each school building, the professional issues representative, which would parallel that of the building representative. This person would \r\n\r\n,,\\ , \r\nMrs. Jimmie Jackson \r\nApril 26, 1982 -2 \r\n\r\nbe available to counselor assist teachers in educational matters and would \r\nbe trained to be facilitators in professional issues circles, based on the study circle concept. These are small, informal, democratic groups (up to 20 \r\nmembers) in which participants select a topic to explore. They gather \r\nresources and share ideas and information on the topic, usually for a period of from 8 to 10 weeks. The product may simply be ne,;\' information gained by \r\nparticipants, recommendations on a particular matter, or creation of informaâ€¢tional material for colleagues. \r\nThere are a lot more details I\'d like to discuss with you which would take too much time here. I was thinking some or all of your representatives in the schools might be plugged into a program like this, unless it would be too burdensome. \r\nWe\'re going to pilot this program in about 30 schools in Miami in the fall, and I wondered if you think there might be any interest in D.C. The effect, hopefully, would be more involvement of union members at the building level, a perception that the union addresses and serves individuals\' professional needs on a regular basis, and an image of the union in the community that it does more than ask for more money. \r\nAlso, Rufus suggested that the local union might sponsor its own QuEST Conference. I responded that this should be discussed with you to see how this fits into teacher center activities. \r\nLet\'s talk soon about these matters. Give me a call, or I\'ll try and reach you soon â€¢ \r\n., \r\nSincerely, \r\n\'-\\\',. \" I fl.

Department of Education, the AFT Teacher Center Resource Exchange provides technical assistance to teachers, administrators, am universities and colleges of education personnel for the development and operation of teacher center programs. During the past three years, teacher center leaders have had an opportunity to share information regarding exemplary programs am promising inservice practices. Through the nine Teacher Center: How To modules, special emphasis has been placed on collaboration between teachers and university staff. The project has established dialogue, which challenges teacher educators to envision new rrodels for preservice as well as inservice education for teachers. Resources are made available through the Teacher Center Clearinghouse. More than one hundred university personnel receive materials regularly from the Clearinghouse. \r\nUniversity representatives and teacher center leaders participate in conferences scheduled by the AFT Teacher Center Resource Exchange. A recent two-day session was directed by Geocge Denemark, Dean of Education at the University of Kentucky. His paper entitled, nA Case for Extended Teacher Preparation Programs,n stimulated discussion on the relationship between preservice and inservice programs. The American Federation of Teachers has long advocated an internship program for beginning teachers, and the teacher center is the mst likely meeting place for master teachers and teacher educators as they initiate the beginning teacher into the school district in the 1980s. Participants cited special plans for the beginning teachers in Englam where ninducteesn spend one day a week with master teachers visiting classrooms, working in the teacher center, or taking a course. \r\nTeachers as researchers has been a recurring theme in the AFT Teacher Center Resource Exchange literature and scheduled seminars. An ongoing exchange through discussion, seminars, am publications with the Teacher Corps Program has linked teacher center directors with Teacher Corps personnel who share experiences and insight. The most recent exchange with Lee Morris, from the University of Oklahoma, has established the theme for the coming year. Research, Adaptation, and Change, a publication he edited challenges teacher center leaders to literally take the knowledge base off the library shelves and bring it into the classroom. University professors and teacher center leaders must collaborate if this goal is to be realized. \r\nA number of the special collaborative IIDdels for the involvement of higher education personnel in teacher center programs described in this publication have been shared during teacher center seminars as well as through Clearinghouse publications. Teacher center leaders place special emphasis on the collaborative process whereby teachers and university professors develop courses scheduled at the teacher center for graduate credit. Because teachers have identified credit courses as one important teacher center activity, careful \r\nconsideration is given to coordinating the theory with the real life of the classroom teacher. \r\nContact for Further Information Patr icia Weiler \r\n(202) 797-4461 \r\nWHY COLLAOORATION? EXPERIENCES OF \'mE \r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TEACHER CENTER \r\n\r\nJimmie Jackson \r\nDistrict of COlumbia Teacher Center \r\n\r\nInstitutions of Higher Education continue to play a vital role in the preparation of teachers. Original legislation that authorized teacher centers required collaboration of professional organizations, Boards of Education, and Institutions of Higher Education in the planning oÂ£-staff development for classroom teachers. This legislation led to the active involvement of classroom teachers with higher education in the scrutiny of inservice programs. \r\nThe District of COlumbia Teacher Center established a committee of classroom teachers, deans of education, faculty advisors and teacher center staff to explore the feasibility of offering courses, workshops, lectures, and seminars that would be relevant to classroom teachers. This collaborative effort included Howard University, Catholic University, University of the District of Columbia, University of Maryland, University of Virginia, Gecrge Washington University, Trinity College, and American University. \r\nClassroom teachers indicated on a survey that their interests were in the areas of reading, human relations, supervision and special education. Three Master\'s programs were then negotiated with Gecrge Washington University so that the D.C. Teacher Center was the degree-granting agent through the University. All of these courses are taught at the teacher center. In addition, the courses can be offered at a lower rate for teachers through the Teacher Center. \r\nIn designing courses to be offered at the Center, the planning committees considered many areas of concern to teachers. The most profound criterion was that the content meet the needs of classroom teachers in terms of the requirements, application, and usefulness. Very effective relationships have been established with the area universities in meeting this objective. Programs, dates, time, and assistance are readily available to classroom teachers. There is a congenial atmosphere for studying that includes a library with available resources and references easily accessible to_teacher_~.__ T~~~hers can also type and xerox papers at the teacher center site. While the availability of these resources may seem trivial, they are essential to teachers who lolOrk full time. The flexible hours and dates are very helpful to teachers who want to continue or update their education. \r\nThis collaborative arrangement encourages the opportunity to re-evaluate â€¢the teacher education curriculum. Most of the participating university faculty listened to the cries of the teachers as the teachers discovered that their real needs had not been satisfied in the areas of management, record keeping and \r\nday-to-day activities. This willingness to listen by university faculty was clearly shown by the agreeable attitude for providing courses and redesigning courses an:! curriculum to meet the everyday needs of teachers. \r\nThe collaboration also provides a chance for faculty and students at the university to learn at the center. Teacher education majors have been sent to the center to review curriculum and become aware of classroom settings in the \r\nD.C. Public Schools. Many attend the workshops on classroom management and request assistance with writing objectives. Through collaboration, the university faculty become aware that some education courses do not meet the needs of beginning teachers. The need to revitalize and restructure teacher edUcation curriculum and courses so that they are I\'Ik)re reality based has been realized. University faculty also have the opportunity to assist classroom teachers in rethinking methodology and pedagogical techniques. The interaction has been fantastic for both university based faculty and classroom teachers in the shared learning environment of the Center. \r\nThe collaboration offers an ongoing needs assessment in terms of what is practical and relevant in the classroom. This input from classroom teachers provides teacher education faculty with first-hand information and insight into what is generally expected of teachers in today\'s classrooms. Better guidance for prospective teachers is often the result. Making the teacher education curriculum and guidance more relevant for the practitioner can best be fulfilled with collaboration between teacher educators and classroom teachers. \r\nSince colleges am universities are facing intensified competition, the development of innovative, creative and attractive programs will be important. In the past, many teachers have believed that the teacher education curriculum was designed by professors who had been out of the classroom for 10-20 years. Collaboration offers the opportunity for both teacher educators and teachers to participate in the assessment and lOOdification of teacher education programs. This collaborative process also will encourage classroom teachers to be more appreciative of the talents of university faculties. \r\nWhen students are not satisfied with their undergraduate education, they are often insecure in their performance. Thus, the curriculum must be re-examined. tfllile the curriculum should not be changed just for the sake of change, it must be improved. Students entering a classroom as the teacher must believe that they have received the best education possible in undergraduate school. Programs mustÂ· serve the real needs of students. Teachers should be able to evaluate teacher education curriculum and the application of it in the classroom. The extent to which teachers and teacher educators collaborate may determine the survival of some institutions. Teacher centers encourage such COllaboration. \r\nTHE FIRST OPERATIONAL YEAR 1980-81 \r\n\r\n1. Purpose and Development \r\nThe Hammond Teacher Center First Year Operational Grant Proposal was developed by the Hammond Teacher Center Policy Board and submitted in March, 1980. The purpose of the grant was to design and implement professional growth opportunities which would help teachers meet the ongoing educational needs. of \r\nâ€¢ i , \r\ntheir students. The F~rst Year Operational Grant was funded in July of 1980. \r\nA permanent location was established at Miller School in Hammond.Â· The director was hired on a part-time basis in April, 1980, and assumed full-time status in September, 1980. The Teacher Center issued bulletins and calendars to teachers in public and parochial schools in Ilammond during the Spring of 1980 to inÂ£o~ teachers about the project and the tentative calendar for activities which would begin in September. The Teacher Center opened its doors on schedule, September 8, 1980, with a complete schedule which included a variety of works~ops and activities. (See Appendix B for a detailed schedule of Teacher Center activities.) , \r\n;, \r\nApproximately 1,500 participants have taken part in Center activities between September, 1980, and January, 1981. The Hammond Teacher Center has become a responsive agent in the community, providing services for teach\'er, parent, and community organizations. Teachers ~rom the parochial and pre-schools in Hammond have been included in programs and activities. Indiana Uni_versi t:1 northwest and Purdue University Calumet have co-sponsored credi t cours~s through Teacher Center workshops. The TC3cher Center now prepares to continue during its second year of operation to expand its effective response as \r\na service agency for educators and parents in Hammond. \r\n\',. ., \r\n\r\n\" \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE i: TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE OF THE TEACHER CENTER PROJECT BY THE POLICY BOARD. Governance and Implementation. The Policy Board has met monthly throughout \r\n\'the first operational year. Development of policies and procedures have \',continued and. plans\' of action for each objective have been-implemented. (Appendix A, Objective 1; sections A and B.) \r\n\" \r\nTeacher\"Center Staff. A job description was created for the role \"Coordinator,\" later changed to \"Directo.r,\" of the Hammond Teacher Center. Notice of vacancy was advertised in Teacher Center Newsletter Vol. I, Nos. 1 & 2, and posted on office bulletin boards in all Hammond schools as well as in the Hammond Teacher Federation Newsletter. Mona D. Sherman, basic reading teacher at Morton High School, was hired on a part-time basis in April, 1980. She began full-time direction of the Center in September, 1980. (A job description is located in Management Plan) â€¢ A full-time clerk-typist, Pam. DeWitt, was hired in September. Tne position was advertised by the School City of Hammond. Two program coordinator positions were ~dve~tised in the Hammond Teacher Center \r\n\"$ \r\nNewsletters, Hammond Teacher Federation Newsletters, and in all Hammond Schools by the\'Personnel Department. Virginia Jemiola, special education teacher at Eggers Middle School, and Gardest Gillespie, industrial arts teacher at Hammond High School, were hired in November, 1980. Vitaes of the director and program assistants appear in the Management Plan on page 70. Resource teachers are hired as the need arises by the Center. \r\nOn-Site Visitations and Conferences. During the planning and first operational year, members of the Policy Board visited six teacher centers. These on-site visits were made at teacher centers in Lafayette, Indianapolis,\r\n, \r\nColumbus, and Gary, ~diana; Chicago, Illinois; and Great Rivers, Wisconsin. \r\n, I \r\nTwo presentations were made by the Director at State Wide Conferences: \r\n\r\n\"t.fuy Come to the Teacher Center?\", Northwest Region, Indiana Association for the Education of Young Children, Hanunond, Indiana, April 4, 1981; and \"The Role of \r\nthe Teacher Center: Reading in the Schools,\" Indiana State Rec(;liug Teachers \r\n.-\r\nConference, March 28, 1981, Indianapolis, Indiana. Conferences participated in by Policy Boa~d members and the Director included Mid-West Cluster meetings in LaCrosse, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois; American Federation of Teachers Technical Assistance Conferences, and the Syracuse Documentation Conference, July 1980, New Orleans, Louisiana. The Director partlicipated in a Dir~ctor\'s \r\nInternship Program sponso.red by the Office of Teacher Centers, Department of Education, Washington, D.C., August 1980. \r\nLocallyâ€¢. Teacher Center \"Awareness Programs\" were offered during faculty conferences at .all Hammo.nd schools by the Director from September 1980 to June 1981. Presentations ~o1ere made for the Hammond Parent Teacher Association, Hammond School Board, Hammond Administrators, the Administrators of the Diocese of Gary Schools, and the Hammond Area Reading Council. \r\nPolicy Board Hember Orientation. In December 1980 a training session for \r\norienting new Policy Board members was held. At this time, as originally \r\n.. \r\nscheduled in the Policy Manual. one-I:,;hird of the Board members was replaced ,.,ith new personnel (Appendix A, Objective 1; section E). \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE iii: TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE PROGRA}1S DESIGNED TO MEET THE IDENTIFIED \r\nINSERVICF. NEEDS OF THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF. \r\nDirections and Hethods for Building Inservice Programs. â€¢ ~o In addition to the \r\nneeds assessment surveys and follmv-up information gathered from teachers described unde~ Objective ii, the Hammond Teacher Center has identified and implemented other ways to provide services to both teachers and parents in the community ~ Suggestions for-the Teacher Center programs have been collected through notes and calls received at the Center, comments from teachers at Awareness Programs conduc~ed as part of faculty meetings, contact made by Teacher Center representatives, the director, and faculties, as well as teacher, .\' parent, and community organ~zations. \r\nTeacher-Administrator Cooperation. When teachers at Hammond\'s elementary schools needed an opportunity to examine materials which their schools anticipated purchasing, they requested the assistance of the Teacher Center. The Teacher Center contacted representatives from e(ght book publishers and sponsored a materials display. Teachers were given released time to view the display. \'This allowed them to make decisions on which materials they wished to purchase. This even led to nelv levels of cooperation and planning among teachers and administrators in sharing material funds. \r\nThe Teacher Center was requested by the Inservice Committee of\' the School \r\nCity of Hammond to provide released time inservice workshops in Gifted and \r\nTalented Educcltion for all elementary school teachers. Three sites were \r\nI \r\nselected and three presenters were hired by the Teacher Center. The first of these workshops was prese.nted on December 10, 1980. The workshops l.,ere received so well b~ the teachers that two more released mornings have been planned so thoat each teacher wi 11 have an opportunity to hear all three presenters. \r\ni \r\n\r\nThe Teacher Center has been working with the Gifted and Talented Coordinator \r\n~. \r\nin planning workshops for teachers of the Gifted and Talented. The administration and the Teacher Center jointly applied for two one-day inservice workshops that were offered by the Indiana Department of Instruction. Our request has been accepted and the first all-day workshop was held on January 13, 1981. The topic was \"Identifying Gifte~ and Talented Students.\" The follow-up workshop will be held on March 20, 1981. There was no charge for this workshop. \r\n~he Teacher Center and the School City of Hammond jointly applied for a $400 \r\n.\" \r\nmini-grant from the Department of Public Instruc;tion in inservice for Teachers of Gifted and Talented. On January 30, thEiTeacher Center... and the School City \r\n-.~ \r\nof Hammond ~o1ere notified that our-proposal was accepted. Currently, the Teacher Center and the CoorÂ·dinator of Gifted and Talented are working on presenting a mini-conference on Gifted and Talented that will take place this Spring. \r\nVariety of Activities and Evaluations. During the 1980-81 school year, the lIammond Teacher Center offered teachers a variety of workshops, seminars, college-credit courses, and special interest programs. A complete list of programs and activities planned by the Center is included with attendance figures and other descriptive information in Appendix B. Activities have included sessions on making materials and art objects for classroom use, programe, for teachers in srecia1 subject areas, classroom manage~ent techniques, workshops for substitutes, information about legal and financial concerns, sessions in personality development, foreign language training, and \r\ncollege-credit courses. The responses to these programs were measured through \r\n... \r\nregi~_tration prior to meetings, attendance records of the meetings, and \r\n\r\n.. \r\nresponses on forms distr.ibuted following the programs. Effective activities were rescheduled at future dates and additional workshops offered when requested. Sites other than ,. the Teacher Center are used when it is appropriate. \r\n\r\nConmunity Involvement. By funding two art training workshops in October and \r\nNovember I the Hammond Teacher Center has assis ted the \"Hammond Picture Persons I\" \r\na group of cor.ununi ty volunteers who present art programs in ~. the Hammond \r\nelementary schools and the Gary Diocese. The workshops were presented as a \r\nresult of a direct request from the president of the \"Hammond Picture Persons.\" \r\nThe Teacher Center has developed several programs for parents describing \r\neducatio~al goals in schools and assisting parents Ln creating instructional \r\nmaterials for their children at the Center. \r\nCooperative ventures ~ith teacher organizations have led to the Teacher \r\nCent,er providing programs of interest on a joint basis with the Hammond Area \r\n.. \r\nReading Council, the Association for the Gift~d and Talented, the I~diana Association for Education of Young Children, and the Indiana Northwest Economics \r\n. ~ \r\n.~ \r\nCouncil. The President of the Hammond Parent Teachers Association represented \r\nthe Hammond Teacher Center at the Indiana State Conference, \"Effective Schools \r\nof the 80\'s,\" on January 23, 1981. Regular communication has been established \r\nbetween the Director and the Parent Teacher Associatipn in planning and \r\npresenting workshops for parent groups at the Teacher Center. \r\n-\r\nAs a result of these and other efforts, a network of cooperative \r\nrelationships has been established for future inservice programs. \r\n\r\n\" \r\n\r\nJ \r\nr\\D~I~MI..I \r\nOn February 11, 19~1, The ~chool ~oard of nade County, !=loriria officially authorized the su hl11ission of an application for a Teacher Education Center gra nt desi~ ned to ex Dan d the accol11 rnodation of the inservice needs of teachers of nade and Monroe r.ounties, F\'lorirla. \r\nThese needs are being partial1y met at the oresent tiMe hy the Dade-~10nroe Teacher Education Center which It,as establisheri to !T1eet the requirements of Florida Statutes (see A.poendix ~) that each county in the state be involved in a Teacher Education Center by ,July 1, 1Q19. \r\nDade Cou nty, Florida has\' a \\\'Iides pread multi-ethnic population. The population has increased since May, 19R(\'I when the l\'\\oatlift from r1ariel, Cuba saw Ino,OOO new refu gees come into the area in a matter oT 3 months. Also, up to 300 Haitian refu gees arrive on the shores ,of the County \\\'Jeekly. The County covers 27 municipalities and is spread over a vast geographic area of approximately 2,(\'\\\"\" square ml1es. (<\\ee A p pen di x E.) \r\nMonroe Cou nty is com prised of the F10rida Keys an d is a narrow lOO-mile long strip ,of islands extending from the southern tiP of Dadp.County to Key \\~est. It is, therefore, imperative that a unique technological approach be established to meet the vast neerls of thp. teacher in both counties. \r\nThe puroose of this proposal is to request funds to exotlnd the \r\n. op portu nities for teachers of the area to gain ad ditional s kills which wl1l \r\nultimatel Y enable them to better meet the needs of the diverse stu dents \r\nin their\' classrooms. It is proposed that this expansion be accoMolished \r\nthrough the development of television f\\nd radio technolog v which will \r\nultimately insure greater cost effectiveness and will increase the \r\nQua ntity of training ~ossibl1ities as well as im prove the quality of \r\n\r\nservice. -\r\nProject TR A.IrI (Television and qadio Aoplied to Tnserv1ce ~!eeds) is requesting S42,82~ for a planninq grant for the first year, with significantly increased funds for implementation in the second ann thirn years. \r\nThe Project ,,,in provide: \r\n1. 	\r\nProduction of audio-visual presentations to \"e neliverecf in Dade County through tV/O existing public television stations, a four-chan nel closed circuit television station, a ou hlic rarlio station and other apolicable media resources. \r\n\r\n2. 	\r\nnU olication of the above l\'lresentations in video-tane cassette forn for use in the three qeogranhic centers in Monroe County â€¢ \r\n\r\n\r\n.. \r\n3. 	\r\n11t11ization of cahle television facilities in ~onroe Count~ to meet the needs of its teachers. \r\n\r\n4. 	\r\nFollow-up activities and services to oarticinants provideti bv the use of substitutes in classrOOMs of nart-tiMe teacher/facilitators. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

ABSTRACT \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nThe Secondary School Teacher Center Component (SSTCC) is funded as an ] addition and separate component to the existing Michigan state-funded Detroit :~enter for Professional Growth and Development. The SSTCC seeks to extend services to Detroit area teachers,. students, paraprofessional s, and admini straâ€¢\"tors and to develop its potential to serve as the Mid-West Cluster Microcomputer \r\nInservice Training Center. The major area of concentration for the Detroit \r\nSSTCC is the addressing of the future-oriented communication skills needs of I \r\nstudents and teachers. \r\nI \r\nI\r\nThe Secondary School Teacher Center Component is governed by an 18 memâ€¢-! ! ber Policy Board of which 61% are classroom teachers. The Policy Board takes an active role in the directing, supervising and monitoring of all operations. Policy Board members serve on planning task forces and represent the Center at conferences and seminars. c=; ! \r\ni \r\nI \r\n.\"\'! \r\nThe SSTCC provides services to 7,200 educational personnel in the 84 \r\npublic middle and senior high schools and 42 non-public secondary schools in \r\nthe service area. \r\n\r\nDuring its first operational year the SSTCC will meet the future-oriented \r\ncOl1111unication skills inservice training needs of teachers and \"students in the \r\nservice area, develop and pilot future-oriented communication skills curriculum \r\nmodules, develop procedures and training courseware needed to operate as a microâ€¢\r\ncomputer training center for service area educators\" and their students, establish . a multi-media future-oriented communication skills resource and dissemination \r\nservice, and establish a Mid-West Cluster Microcomputer Inservice Training Center. \r\nAll activities will flow from priorities\' determined by the assessment of \r\nstudent and teacher needs. Funds for this continuation grant will enable the \r\nPolicy Board to implement the SSTCC as a vital and responsive way to prepare \r\nDetroit educators and their students for the communication skills that will be \r\nrequired in the decades to come. \r\n\r\nxii \r\n\r\n1 \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES FROM ORIGINAL PROPOSAL \r\nA.

Large numbers of Spanish speaking bi lingual students have moved into the district. \r\nMany bilingual teachers have been hired by the school system but more bilingual teachers are needed. Bilingual teachers need help in English as a Second Language and since bilingual children are currently mains~reamed into regular class, regular class teachers need help with conversational Spanich. \r\nThis development has reflected upon the Teacher Center in several ways; \r\na. 	\r\nRegular class teachers have problems communicating with bilingual parents and students. To meet this need, the Teacher Center has offered many courses in conversational Spanish. However, the Teacher Center is unable to fund enough courses to satisfy the large number of applicants. \r\n\r\nb. 	\r\nBilingual teachers have requested assistance in improvement of speaking and wirting skills in English. \r\n\r\nc. 	\r\nBilingual parents have requested assistance in English as a Second Language during the school day, to assist in communication with teachers and WIthin the community. The Teacher Center is currently conducting classes for parents in English as a Second language during the school day when parents are free but again, the number of applicants is greater than funds will allow. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives are to: Develop a retraining program in Bilingual Education for regular class teachers. Conduct ongoing Conversation Spanish Classes for teachers. Provide English as a Second language programs for bilingual parents and teachers Provide Multicultural Education for parents and teachers \r\nThe Policy Board of the District Five Teacher Center feels that these objectives will be best met by adding a bilingual staff person to the Teacher Center staff to carry out \r\n\r\nr I, \r\nSecond, liAs early as 1967 the President\'s Science Advisory Committee said that since the computer was such a valuable and versatile tool in society, Students attending schools who have not been exposed to the knowledge about computers will be poorly prepared for the world of the 1980\'s and 1990\'s. Many educators believe that although most students will not be computer technologists, the influence of the computer on future jobs is so important th~.t students should be made aware of the computer--What it is and what it does. Computer awareness courses should be part of every curriculum in every school. 11* \r\nIn order to create the computer awareness program implied by this statement, teachers need training in computer language. Programs of instruction must be developed by teachers for use by students. These computerized instructional programs should be based upon the regular school program \r\n0 \r\nThe objectives are; To develop a cadre of teachers, consisting of at least one teacher from each \r\nbuilding. The cadre of teachers will be trained to Yiite educational programs \r\nand train other teachers to deliver the program to students. \r\nTo develop a program for students based on the regular curriculum of the district. \r\n\r\nPrograms for special needs, regular students, and gifted and talented students will be developed. In order to achieve these objectives a microcomputer with terminals will be located at the Teacher Center. The microcomputer will be used to train teachers, write educational programs and on loan, during the school day, :0\" use by students in the classrooms. \r\n\r\nBar\"\'ord Te.ehera\' Center\' \r\n\r\n-for Persona, and Pro/eâ€¢â€¢\'onal Orowth-\r\nPART I -ABSTRACT \r\nThe Hartford Teachers \"Center will provide professional and personal development services to the staff of Hartford\'s Public and Non-Public Schools. Approximately 2,600 teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators comprise the instrucâ€¢tional resources which serve 31,000 pupils. \r\nA collaborative effort by individuals representing the respective staffs has resulted in this proposal for services to teachers. Participants in the planning of this project are committed to the development and utilization of a vehicle \r\n(the Hartford Teachers\' Center) which will assist teachers in professional and personal development. \r\nThe Hartford Teachers\' Center Policy Board is composed of \r\nteachers and representatives of classroom paraprofessionals, \r\nschool principals, central of\'fice administrators, non-public \r\nschools, higher education and parent organizations. Toâ€¢gether they have determined that the Hartford Center will: \r\n-involve teachers actively in. planning, governing \r\nand evaluating the functioning of the Center, \r\n-focus on responding to teacher needs, both \r\nprofessional and personal, \r\n\r\n-2â€¢\r\n42 Char\'er Oak Ave. Hartford,Conn. 01$103-566-6715 \r\n\r\n-establish activities which will address teacher needs on a holistic basis--assistance with professional and personal growth. \r\nBased on the above, the scope of this project will include programmatic \r\nactivities designed to: \r\n-meet teacher professional needs, \r\n-\'meet. teacher personal needs, \r\n-meet school system priorities, \r\n-meet individual school priorities. \r\n\r\n, Program, implementation will center on activities which are based on the \r\nI \r\n1 expressed needs of teachers. \r\nJ .f Alliance with the University of Connecticut will make a wide range\r\n\'f \r\nI \r\n\r\nof expertise available.

There are fifty-six public school distric,ts, containing 328 schools, plus 144 non-publicschools in the 300 square miles that make up Nassau County. \r\nSTRUCTURE \r\nThe Local Education Agency for the Nassau County Regional Teacher Center is the Board of Cooperative Eduâ€¢cational Services (BOCES) of Nassau County. This is an intermediate district which prQvides a wide range of shared educational services. and programs to the fifty-six school districts in the county. In addition, the BOCES serves \'as an agent of the State Education Department and many state agencies have their local offices in the BOCES central office building. Our teacher center is housed in a BOCE)facility, the Nassau Education Resource Center (NERC). This is a huge professional library and educational resource center and it serves as the \"home base\" for our proj~ct. \r\nIn addition, our project is directly affiliated with one school ,district in each of the four geographicalquadrants of the county. At these locations, the district administration and the teachers organization (and memberâ€¢ship) have joined with us to establish mini-centers, which we call Satellite Centers. At each of the four centers, workshops, seminars, demonstrations and other inservice activities are held on a regular basis. Materials and \r\n-16â€¢\r\nresources are available in the Satellites to help meet locally identified needs as well. Each Satellite Center is governed by a Site Committee comprised of five or seven members, with a majority of the members being teachers. \r\nOur Policy Board and staff are particularly proudof the close affiliation and mutually supportive relationâ€¢ship which exists between our project and the following: \r\nBOCES of Nassau County: William T.

Each center represents considerable commitment by the individual sÂ·chool district board of education, central office and buildinglevel administration, teacher organization, .parents, students, and individual classroom teachers. \r\nAt each site, workshops and courses are offered during\r\neach quarter of the year. Content is determined by formal \r\nand informal needs assessment and evaluation of each \r\nactivity, both of which are constant, on-going procedures. \r\n\r\nAll activities take place under the supervision of a \r\nPolicy Board or site committee, with its teacher majority\r\ndesign. \r\n\r\nThe second major aspect of the operational design is \r\nthe availability of on-site assistance to educators, in \r\ntheir own schools, by our Staff Development Specialist.\r\nA variety of workshops are presented to teachers in this \r\nmanner, and in-Class demonstrations of new techniques and \r\nmethods are an integral part of the service. WorkshopsÂ· \r\nfor parents, provided in the same manner, have elicited a \r\n\r\n-18â€¢\r\ntremendous response. We are investigating sources of additional funding to expand this part of our service, due to the overwhelming demand for it. \r\nFinally, we are particularly proud of our ComputerizedInformation Service which has put the latest available educational research into the hands of over 600 Nassau County educators, since its inception in August, 1980. This is another service which we hope to expand in the \r\nnear future. . \r\nCONTENT \r\nThe content of our courses, workshops, and other activities is determined, primarily, by needs which have been expressed to us by Nassau County educators. Topicshave included: Math Games, ~friting Skills , Alternative Careers for Teachers, Human Relations in the Classroom, Mainstreaming of Handicapped Children, Stress Reduction for Teachers and Students, Computer Assisted Instruction, Motivation and Discipline, Film Animation for the Classroom, Puppetry, Critical Television Viewing, English As a Second Language, etc. \r\nEVALUATION FINDINGS \r\nIn our first eight months of operation, more than 6,000 educators (verified by signatures) have attended activities at one of our five sites, or been served in their own schools. In addition, more than 4,000 telephoneinquiries have been taken, in the Regional Center alone. \r\nEvaluation forms are distributed and collected at every course or workshop given at our five locations, for all users. of the computerized information service, and at all on-site workshops for parents and/or teachers. \r\nRespondents have evaluated our services and staff as being good to excellent 99 times out of 100. Our Staff Development Specialist receives evaluations that are consistently so outstanding from parents, teachers, and administrators, that it is almost embarrassing. Howâ€¢ever, we recognize that there is so much more ~hat we could be doing, and many ways in which our services and programscould be, expanded or improved. We are all committed to that course of action, as we strive to keep pace with the constantly changing world around us. New ideas, new energyand renewed enthusiasm for the ultimate triumph of education over ignorance propels us ever onward. \r\n-19-\r\n\r\nPOLICY BOARD \r\nThe Nassau County Regional Teacher Center is governedby a Policy Board comprised of twenty-four members and their designated alternates.

This large, suburban area on Long Island contains 56 independent public school districts, along with approximately 100 private institutions. The total (K-12) teacher population has been estimated to be about 19,000. The local towns span the economic spectrum. \r\nFor three years, members of the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) worked cooperatively with faculty from the School of Education, Hofstra University. Together with administrators and community representatives the NYSUT/Hofstra Teacher Center was planned and established. \r\nThe NYSUT/Hofstra Teacher Center has a complex conâ€¢ceptual design that encompasses both process and product components.. Its strong base of support comes from the uniqueunion/university linkage. Four university professors serve twenty-five percent of their time on staff at the Center. These specialist positions were written into the originalproposal. The names of these conSUltants have changed as the needs of the Center became more defined or redefined; but the basic university-involved., organizational \'structure remains the same. In fact, it has strengthened as awareness \r\n-38â€¢\r\nlevel and programs became more known. The Center Director and the Program Development Specialist are both teachers. From this duality of input and output has emerged a strong way of working. \r\nPolicy \r\nBoard \r\n\r\n\r\nTwo graduate assistants, one stUdent aide, one fullâ€¢time and one part-time secretary serve to support this staff structure. Activities take place at various campusfacilities and at school sites throughout the county. \r\nGOALS \r\nThe major goal of the Center is to increase teacher effectiveness in meeting learners\' needs. An important aspect of this work stresses the collegial and complementaryroles of teachers and university faculty in accomplishingthe aims of the Center. \r\nTen objectives identified by teachers have been set forth for the Center: \r\n1. 	To train a cadre of teachers who \'can serve as inservicecurriculum leaders in their own schools and/or districtsâ€¢ \r\n.. \r\n\r\n-39â€¢\r\n2. 	To enhance teachers\' curriculum developmentand evaluation skills; to develop and evaluate curriculum materials to meet teacher-identified student needs. \r\nJ. 	To develop a resource file of information conâ€¢cerning expertise of teachers, innovative programs, materials and activity ideas for use with children. \r\n4. 	\r\nTo enhance teacher effectiveness in working with children by offering short-term workshops. \r\n\r\n5. 	\r\nTo enhance teacher effectiveness by offering field consultation. \r\n\r\n6. 	\r\nTo enhance teachers\' educational problem-solving and evaluation skills; to examine and proposesolutions to teacher-identified educational problems and to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed solutions. \r\n\r\n7. 	\r\nTo develop a Media-Communications Center. \r\n\r\n8. 	\r\nTo provide services to paraprofessionals,counselors, parent volunteers, administrators, and school board members in order to supportthe learning process. \r\n\r\n9. 	\r\nTo provide liaison with the New York State Education Department. \r\n\r\n\r\n10. To establish linkages with other teacher centers. \r\nTo attain these objectives, specific plans have been proposedand programs implemented for the initially funded three-year period. \r\nOPERATIONS \r\nThe actual center site is housed on the university campus. The substantive thrust of this collaborative effort emphasizes teacher leadership, curriculum evaluation, and skill development that enables teachers to serve as resources to other teachers. \r\nThis Center received its grant under the Institute of Higher Education (IHE) section of the federal program -October 1, 1979. \r\n-40-\r\n\r\nCONTENT \r\nIn the year and a half that the Center has been in operation, movement has been made on all ten of the Center objectives. \r\nSeventy teachers representing 15 districts, 1 privateand 1 parochial school in Nassau County have attended the Teacher Leader Inservice Program. Fifty additional teachers attended the two credit Models of Teaching course offered in the Spring of 1981 as follow-up and extension of the Teacher Leader training. Numerous activities and diverse programs have been initiated in the local classrooms and districts as a result of this Centering experience. \r\nFive Curriculum Development and Evaluation Groupshave developed through the Center. Their topics of focus are: \r\n1. \r\nThe Gifted and Talented \r\n\r\n2. \r\nWriting\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. Social Studies \r\n4. \r\nEnvironmental Studies \r\n\r\n5. \r\nConsumer Education \r\n\r\n\r\nBoth large-scale conferences and small afternoon workshops have been held in connection with this ongoing work. \r\nFive Problem-Solving and Evaluation Groups have also been identified by the Center and sessions are consistently being launched in these areas of concern and inquiry.\' \r\n1. \r\nStress Management \r\n\r\n2. \r\nParents and Education \r\n\r\n\r\nJ. Mainstreaming\r\n4. \r\nEnergy\r\n\r\n5. \r\nTeacher Exchange \r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with the above group activity, individual conâ€¢sUltations are also provided by the Center specialists and opportunity for individual SEARCH requests have been faciliâ€¢tated by the Center\'s partici,Eation in the statewide computer network. The NYSUTjHofstra Teacher Center is starting to develop its own unique data base of People and Program Resources. All of this information is now readilyaccessible through our portable computer technology. Awareâ€¢ness Sessions are frequently held at schools throughout the county. \r\n-41-\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, and with the full cooperationof Hofstra University, the Center has been able to offer several of its activities for graduate credit. This year,15 credits have f+owed through Center involvement. The options made available to teachers have been flexible and varied. \r\nServices to parents, administrators, counselors and staff in the schools has also been expanded this year.Linkages with other Teacher Centers, the university system,NYSUT, the state education department and the federal programs continue to both deepen and widen. \r\nEVALUATION FINDINGS \r\nThe Center has found that teachers actively respondand participate in events led or held by other teachers. Over 2,400 teachers attended workshops held in our first year. This year we estimate and are experiencing an even greater involvement. \r\n~fe have found that teachers (K-12) do come forward for courses or conferences that are of interest to them and that meet their concerns. We have also found the individual needs of teachers to be strong, diverse and complex. \r\nWe have found that teachers do like to receive graduate credit or acknowledgment for their efforts and that teachers are \"risk-takers.\" They are willing to initiate changein their own classrooms and working worlds. They are looking for a professional support system and they are in need of that problem-solving linkage. \r\nlnTe have disoovered that the results of our efforts are beginning to surface as the separate evaluation comâ€¢ponent of our proposal starts to delve into the follow-up aspects of our way of working. Centering on Long Island appears to have a ripple effect and its impact is just now being felt. \r\nPOLICY BOARD  \r\nTeachers  \r\nLen Motisi, Chair Joan O\'Shea, Vice Chair Vita Bottitta Betty Bradley  -Music Teacher, Syosset P.S.

More rigor 66 8 has been introduced into 67 9 curricula, and standards have 68 10 been tightened. Teachers\' salaries 69 11 have been modestly increased, 70 12 and some other additional 71 13 resources have been pumped into 72 14 education. Traditional friends of 73 15 public schools have been 74 16 reactivated, and new allies in the 75 17 business and political 76 18 communities have been found. In 77 19 general and after a period of 78 20 torpor, the interest and concern of 79 21 the public have been redirected to 80 \r\n22 public education. Throughout this 81 \r\n23 period, the AFT and its affiliates 82 \r\n24 led many of these changes, 83 \r\n25 supported others, and. equally 84 \r\n26 important, beat back most of the 85 \r\n27 dangerous and simpleÂ·minded 86 \r\n28 proposals masquerading as 87 \r\n29 education reform. It was a time of 88 both opportunity and danger, and the AFT\'s ability to seize and shape the opportunities on behalf of its members and public education earned us unprecedented and invaluable recognition. \r\nBut there is little reason to be sanguine about the future of public education. Despite recent polls indicating somewhat greater satisfaction with public schools as a result of the reform movement, public education is still in peril. The grades the public gives public education are still low. Fanned by the curtent administration, support for vouchers and tuition tax credits is still at an unprecedented high. The traditional political base of public education is eroding, along with the proportion of the population with school-age children. As for students, performance is still unacceptably mediocre, in terms oftheiroWn future needs and those of the democratic society they will inherit. \r\nThe \"first stage\" of educatIOn reform therefore has provided only partial relief to the problems threatening public education. One reason is that the public expects education reform to produce higher student achievement. but such gains are neither easily nor quickly obtained. While it is unrealistic to expect immediate, tangible improvements from recent reforms, it seems equally true that if positive results are not forthcoming, there will be a backlash against public education, and one from which we may not readily recover. \r\nA second, and more significant, reason for the problems persisting in public education is that much more reform is required, and of a far more basic nature than the first round of reform afforded. Indeed, even if all the better reform measures of the past two years were enacted, they would not be sufficient to ensure a wellâ€¢educated, democratic, productive citizenry-an education of value for all the nation\'s children. not \r\n\r\n,t:) \r\n,\'\" ,\r\n-\r\n2 \r\n\r\n~ \r\n89 just some. They would not be 135 lowering standards is once again \r\n... \r\n90 sufficient to attract and retain a 136 being pursued as a matter of 91 talented teaching force, without 137 public policy. This policy must be 92 whom a fine education system, let 138 vigorously resisted. It is a threat to, 93 alone an education reform 139 all students, but particularly to 94 movement, is impossible. And 140 disadvantaged youngsters for 95 they would not be sufficient to 141 whom public education 96 ensure the future of our union. For 142 represents the best chance of full 97 as long as the educational 143 and equal participation in 98 function of our public schools is 144 American society. It is a threat to 99 impaired, as long as teaching is 145 our current members and to the \r\n100 not a full profession and teachers 146 vitality of our union. And, above 101 are disabled from assuming both 147 all, it is a threat to the future of 102 the responsibilities and 148 public education. The second 103 prerogatives of professionals, 149 stage of reform therefore should 104 public education will remain in 150 be responsive to the demographic 105 jeopardy and, with it, the future of 151 and structural changes now 106 our union. 152 affecting our society, to the needs \r\n153 and aspirations of our members, 154 and to the nation\'s need for a wellâ€¢155 educated, democratic, and 156 productive citizenry. 157 To fulfill these requirements, 158 the second stage of education 159 reform should seek the full 160 professionalization of teaching 161 and the restructuring of public\r\n\r\nIntroduction \r\n\r\n162 schools to promote student 163 learning. In asserting these goals. 164 the AFT Task Force on the Future 107 The AFT Task Force on the 165 of Education recognizes that they 108 Future of Education therefore 166 are not novel ideas for this union. 109 believes that there is a need for a 167 While some of the concepts in the 110 second stage of education reform 168 following report may be new, 111 to sustain and extend the more 169 then, the basic philosophy 112 promiSing features of the first 170 underlying it reaffirms the core of 113 stage and to correct its oversights 171 our beliefs as a union. Throughout 114 and deficiencies. One of the chief, 172 its history, the AFT has 115 and most dangerous, omissions of 173 recognized that unionism and 116 the current reform movement is 174 professionalism are inextricably 117 the failure to take seriously 175 linked and that public schools 118 enough the fact that over half the 176 must be, first and foremost, 119 nation\'s teaching force will have 177 institutions of teaching and 120 to be replaced over less than the 178 learning. We have made, 121 next decade. However, the 179 significant achievements on 122 requisite supply, let alone 180. behalf of our members, and we 123 education\'s fair share of talent, is 181 have made significant 124 not forthcoming. The 182 contributions to public education 125 demographics are against us, as 183 and to the protection and 126 ,. ~re the prevailing salaries and 184 promotion of American 127 professional conditions of . 185 democracy. 128 teaching. 186 But our vision as a union is 129 To date, virtually nothing 187 only partially realized. Much 130 positive has been done to attract 188 more is required, now and for the 131 and retain talented teachers into 189 future-for our members, for 132 the nation\'s public schools. 190 unionism as we practice it. for 133 Instead, the historic tendency in 191 public education, and for the 134 education to meet shortages by 192 nation. \r\n3 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 \r\n\r\n\'\" 	203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218Â· 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 \r\n229 \r\n230 \r\nThe following recommendations therefore represent a set of steps toward the further realization of this vision. They are not \"specifications\" for what to do tomorrow at 9 A.M. but, rather, the direction the Task Force firmly believes the AFT should be pursuing. Nor do these recommendations represent a comprehensive map of our vision or even of a second stage of education reform. Some territory is missing, other terrain needs to be more fully charted. In part, this is a result of the Task Force\'s brief tenure, relative to the time required to explore new ideas fully and responsibly and to suggest their implementation. And in part, it is also because the Task Force views the following ideas and recommendations as a beginning, a bold one to be sure, but only a beginning. \r\nThe Task Forceallticipates and urges AFT members and affiliates to engage in a process of education and discussion of these ideas, as the Task Force itself did. For it is through the collective wisdom of our members, fortified by open and vigorous discourse, that we will continue to be both innovative and responsible, on behalf of our members and for public education. There is much more to be done. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ I â€¢ \r\nI ., \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF TEACHING \r\n231 The AFT recognizes that individual teachers act professionally and there is 232 currently in place the best teaching force the nation is ever likely to see. if 233 present conditions are not altered. Nonetheless, teaching is by no means a 234 profession, by any accepted definition of the concept, nor are teachers treated as 235 full professionals. 236 The ill effects of the status and conditions of teaching as an occupation on 237 teachers and students have long been known to the AFT. Indeed, at the heart of 238 the revolution the AFT wrought in pioneering collective bargaining for teachâ€¢239 ers, and central to the AFT vision of teacher unionism, was and is the belief that 240 unionism and professionalism are inextricably linked-that collective bargainâ€¢241 ing for teachers was and is an important means of attaining the professional izaâ€¢242 tion of teaching and the betterment of public education .. 243 The AFT therefore has a long and proud history of seeking professional-level 244 salaries and benefits for its members, improvements in teacher education and in 245 the knowledge base of teaching, rigorous entry standards, limitations on class 246 size, decision-making authority for teachers, restraints on the power of superâ€¢247 visors, working conditions that enhance teachers\' ability to teach, professional 248 development opportunities, and a host of other particulars related to profesâ€¢249 sional matters. We have made great gains for our members--and shudder to 250 think about how much worse the circumstances of teachers and public educaâ€¢251 tion might have been in the absence of the revolution we wrought. 252 But there is currently a crisis of standards in this nation. and it threatens to 253 wipe out all the gains made on behalf of the teaching force over the past decades 254 and. with these gains, public education as a viable, vital democratic institution. 255 Precipitating this crisis is a massive teacher shortage. During less than a decade. 256 over one half of the current teaching force-over one million people-will be 257 retiring. But neither the number nor the quality of individuals needed to 258 replace the current, aple teaching force is forthcoming. Aside from a few saints. 259 talented individuals will not be attracted to an occupation with low salaries. \r\n5 \r\n\r\n, I \r\n260 limited autonomy and authority. and tough working conditions-a nonprofes-. 261 sional career with few extrinsic rewards and rapidly diminishing intrinsic -, , 262 rewards. 263 At the same time, the nation is experiencing a baby \"boomlet,\" the proporâ€¢264 tion of at-risk students is growing, and the quality of education required by all 265 students must be increased if the American standard of living and the demoâ€¢266 cratic institutions that sustain our freedom are to be preserved and strengthâ€¢267 ened. 268 Given the scenario facing our nation-a smaller absolute number of collegeâ€¢269 age individuals, and consequently, an even smaller pool of prospective teachâ€¢270 ers, few incentives to enter teaching, the ability of other sectors to outbid 271 education for talent, monetarily and otherwise, greater student numbers and 272 needs-the professionalization of teaching is not only desirable. it is a necesâ€¢273 sity. 274 The AFT recognizes that although the professionalization of teaching was 275 not previously achieved. the nation nonetheless benefited from a variety of 276 demographic and social conditions that assured a steady supply of talented 277 teachers, comprised largely of women and minorities. There have been teacher 278 shortages before, although none of this magnitude. More important. during 279 prior teacher shortages, there was little problem in securing for education its 280 requisite share of talented individuals. The prevailing demographic and social 281 conditions. pernicious though some of these were in terms of equal opportunity 282 for women and minorities, were favorable to the education sector. 283 It is now a different world. 284 If the current salary and professional conditions of teaching persist. and if 285 states and localities continue to meet the teacher shortage crisis by issuing 286 credentials to any warm body. not only will teaching be entirely degraded as a 287 career but public education and the students that represent the future of this 288 nation will suffer irreparable harm. 289 The following recommendations are therefore designed to ensure the future 290 of public education and the democratic society it helps support by securing dnd 291 retaining an adequate number of talented teachers through professionalizing 292 teaching. \r\n293 PROFESSIONAL SALARIES 294 â€¢ Beca.1se of the existing shortage of new teachers and .the expansion of that 295 shortage between 1986 and 1995. the AFT advises state federations to seek 296 state-mandated minimum starting salaries for application during this proâ€¢297 jected ten-year period of teacher shortages, where states fall below competiâ€¢298 tive standards. Such state-mandated minimum teacher salaries must be 299 designed on a state-by-state basis to make entering salaries for new teachers 300 reasonably competitive with entering salaries in that state for other profesâ€¢\r\n301 sions requiring comparable education and training. State-level minimums 302 also can be improved upon through bargaining at the local level. 303 â€¢ Because of the existing and impending shortage of teachers. which is in part \r\n304 due to the expected retirement of a substantial share of the experienced 305 teaching force. additional monies are urgently needed to retain experienced 306 teachers. Such funds should be generated at the state level. in addition to 307 higher minimum salaries, and. can be improved upon through bargaining at 308 the local level. \r\n309 SHORTAGE AREAS \r\n310 â€¢ As an incentive to attracting and hiring teachers in all areas of shortages. as 311 they develop. the AFT recommends that locals and school districts consider 312 placing entering teachers in areas of shortage on higher steps of the salary 313 schedule. The salaries of certified teachers currently teachingin these shortâ€¢314 age areas should be raised in those instances where placing an entering \r\n6 \r\n\r\nv 	\", \r\n315 316 \r\nI\" 	317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 \r\n326 327 328 \r\n329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 \r\n338 \r\n339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 \r\n351 352 353 354 355 356 357 \r\n358 \r\n359 360 361 \r\n362 \r\n, 363 364 365 366 367 \r\nteacher in a shortage area on a higher step results in the experienced teacher earning less money. \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nTo meet the\' current shortage and enable talented liberal arts majors, subject area majors, and college graduates with substantive knowledge in areas of critical shortage who have been in other careers, the AFT supports suppleâ€¢mentary licensure programs, coupled with rigorous internships under the guidance of experienced teachers for at least the initial year of teaching. Supplementary licensure and internship programs should in no way be designed or used to reduce or undermine standards for entering teaching. They should, instead, be an alternative route to attaining professional stanâ€¢dards. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nTo attract former teachers back into the profession, the AFT recommends that such teachers be placed at least on the salary schedule step they had attained in the year in which they left teaching. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nIn defining areas of shortage, it is important to account for all areas of shortage, as they develop, and not single out one subject area or grade leveL It is critical that policy makers refrain from responding to teacher shortages by hiring unqualified individuals. Therefore, in addition to the recommendaâ€¢tions above, the AFT urges states and localities to explore credit for academâ€¢ically equivalent work experience outside of teaching, flex-time arrangements, incentives to retain retiring teachers and utilize the expertise of retired teachers, and other means of attracting and retaining qualified teachers. \r\n\r\n\r\nSHORTAGE OF MINORITY TEACHERS Of vital concern to the AFT is the recruitment and retention of minority teachers. In view of our significant role in the civil rights movement. our historic achievements in securing minority teachers equal rights and equal opportunity in the union movement and in the educ~tional enterprise, and because of our belief in the desirability of having schools staffed by teachers who reflect the diversity of the nation\'s heritage, the AFT views with alarm the shrinking number of minority teachers. To address this concern, the AFT urges arid endorses efforts to eliminate substandard educational opportunities, which contribute to inadequate school and test performance by a disproportionate percentage of minorities. The AFT also proposes the following course of action at the national. state, and local levels: \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nEmphasis on a national level to address issues of recruitment and retention of minority teachers as an area of critical shortage. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nPrograms at the high school and college levels to identify talented minority students who are potential teachers, to diagnose their academic strengths and weaknesses, to strengthen their general school performance, to prepare them adequately for and in college. and to improve their performance on collegeâ€¢entry and teaching-entry tests. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nScholarships and loans at the state, local, and federal levels. with targeted funds designated for minorities. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nTarget teacher recruitment and intern programs at institutions that attract significant numbers of minorities. \r\n\r\n\r\n~ACHER EDUCATION AND INDUCTION \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nAll teacher education candidates should have a broadly based, liberal arts undergraduate education, with at least one subject major. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nAll prospective teachers should have a well-structured induction program that includes a one-year internship (for which they could be paid as intern teachers) un~er the supervision of an experienced. knowledgeable teacher. \r\n\r\n\r\n7 \r\n\r\n368 All beginning teachers should be reviewed and assessed by experienced 369 teachers who are prepared for this responsibility. The induction program\' 370 should also involve a residency as a beginning teacher beyond the internship. 371 Peer assistance and review would be applied throughout the residency. \r\n372 â€¢ Experienced teachers should be involved in the planning and development of 373 internship, residency, and peer programs, through the agreement of their 374 union. \r\n375 TEACHER TESTING AND CERTIFICATION \r\n376 â€¢ A new national. nongovernmental board of the teaching profession. comâ€¢377 posed of a majority of experienced teachers, should be created. The board 378 would develop professional standards for teaching on the basis of the knowlâ€¢379 edge and clinical practice base in teaching and oversee the development of a 360 new national assessment procedure for the professional certification of proâ€¢381 spective teachers. The assessment should include high-quality procedures to 382 examine subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical knowledge; as well as 383 pr\')viding for a well-structured clinical induction experience. Each compoâ€¢384 nent of the development and implementation of the assessment should be 385 vigilant about safeguarding objectivity and avoiding racial bias, avoid 386 explicitly or implicitly endorsing any \"one best method\" of teaching pracâ€¢387 tice, and take account of the diversity of students and settings that prospecâ€¢388 tive teachers will face. \r\n389 â€¢ Board certification for new teachers should be awarded only upon successful 390 completion of a rigorous teacher education program, passage of a national 391 teacher entrance examination developed by the profession, and demonâ€¢392 strated teaching competence in intern and residency programs. \r\n393 â€¢ Although board certification initially would be voluntary, states should give 394 serious consideration to adopting the professional certification standards 395 promulgated by the national board as a basis for state teacher licensure. \r\n396 PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT \r\n.~,..... \r\n397 â€¢ In the future. experienced teachers should be eligible for professional career 398 advancement through advanced certification by the new national profes 399 sional board. This board would set the professional standards for Sllt b \r\n.... 	400 advanced certification and determine whether a candidate had met these 401 standards. Such advanced certification should be voluntary and open to all 402 teachers who sought it. \r\n403 â€¢ Teachers should have a variety of opportunities for performing professional 404 roles and advancing within the teaching profession. while continuing to be 405 practicing teachers. Teachers should also have the option of working on ten-, 406 eleven-, or twelve-month contracts in order to perform professional responÂ· 407 sibilities while retaining their status as teachers. \r\n408 â€¢ Teaching must be structured as a lifetime career. Teaching and traditional 409 administration/management must be considered as two separate careers. and 410 teachers\' salaries should not be limited by the salaries paid to administrators:\' 411 managers. \r\n412 TEACHER MOBILITY \r\n413 Although we live in a mobile society, teachers face many roadblocks to 414 practicing their profession if they choose to or are forced to change geographic 415 locations. Teachers moving from state to state must be recertified and often are 416 required to obtain as many as fifteen or more additional college credits. Most 417 IiItates also require teachers who are new residents to teach at least three years. \r\n418 . rcgardles, of previous experience, before qualifying for tenure. Teachers who 419 move to a new district or state are placed on lower steps of the salary scale than \r\n420 their many years of experience warrant and often also lose much or all of their \r\n421 pension entitlements because teacher retirement plans are not transferable~ 422 Because these practices discourage individuals from entering or re-entering 423 teacMng, encourage experienced teachers to leave the profession, exacerbate 424 the teacher shortage crisis, and frequently result in unqualified people being 425 hired to teach in place of qualified teachers, the AFT recommends that: \r\n426 â€¢ Vigorous steps be taken toward the attainment of reciprocity of teacher. \r\n427 license recognition from one state to anoth.er. A means for achieving such \r\n428 reciprocity that warrants serious consideration would be for states to adopt \r\n429 the professional certification standards promulgated by the national board as \r\n430 a basis for state licensure. \r\n431 â€¢ The requirement of earning additional college credits be based upon need 432 and not be an automatic consequence of having changed districts or states. \r\n433 â€¢ School systems preserve full tenure rights and,credit on the salary schedule 434 for lifetime teaching experience. regardless of where these were earned. \r\n435 â€¢ Pension programs should allow teachers who move from state to state to be 436 employed or re-employed without losing benefits. \r\nIt. \r\nSCHOOL STRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE \r\n\r\n\r\n437 The American Federation of Teachers believes that all decisions regarding 438 the establishment, maintenance, or reform of school structure and 439 governance must be based on their effect upon student learning, The litmus 440 test of all such decisions is whether they positively affect student learning 441 and facilitate teachers\' efforts to provide that learning. Therefore. all AFT 442 recommendations are based on the assumption that schools must be learning 443 centered with teachers empowered to carry out their responsibilities. 444 A great deal has been written and discussed about effective schools. Such 445 schools are learning centered. Descriptions of academically effective. 446 learning-centered schools share common factors across the studies and 447 reports: (1) clear goals related to academic learning, (2) high expectations for 448 students and staff, (3) a stable faculty with a clear sense of school ownership 449 and community of shared interests, (4) strong leadership in support of the 450 learning goals of the school-exemplified by a respected principal who 451 involves teachers or a group of teacher leaders. (5) collegial relationships/ 452 collaborative planning among teachers and administrators, (6) school-wide 453 staff development, (7) school site management. (8) learning time given 454 priority, (9) frequent student assessments and feedback, (10) community and 455 district support. and (11) a safe and orderly climate with clear and fairly 456 enforced discipline codes. 457 These school characteristics are consistent with AFT\'s goals and policies 458 related to the professionalization of teaching. They are also in line with 459 AFT\'s long-standing positions ih support of high quality standards for 460 students, teachers. and other personnel. However, these \"effective school\" 461 factors are descriptive rather than prescriptive. That is. they tell how an 462 academically effective school appears; they imply but do not necessarily 463 guide how to create such a school. 464 As public schools are currently organized, the only way for teachers to 465 advance professionally and monetarily is by leaving the classroom. This \r\n9 \r\n\r\n\r\n\" \r\n4f>6 structure diminishes the importance and valtw oftlw roln of tho teacher and ., , 467 thereby impairs student learning. In contrast. it is the fundamental premise 468 of learning-centered schools that teachers are at the core of school success. To 469 recruit bright teachers, equip them with highly sophisticated skills through 470 rigorous training, and then offer them little opportunity to apply their 471 knowledge anq skills in school decision making inevitably will drive capable 472 people away from teaching. Teaching must instead be structured as a lifetime 473 career. 474 The AFT therefore strongly recommends that schools and school systems 475 abolish the factory model of education-management, which treats teachers as 476 workers who must adhere to predetermined practices and follow endless 477 rules and regulations, even against their professional judgment. and assumes 478 that students are passive, uniform cogs in a production process. 479 Professionalizing teaching begins with a clear recognition that teachers must 480 become much more self-regulating, that traditional management 481 responsibilities in public schools must be altered, and that the organization 482 of learning mw;t put student needs above bureaucratic convenience. 483 The following recommendations therefore support the creation of 484 learning-centered schools and advance the professionalization of teaching: \r\n~~ \r\n485 GOALS AND DECISIONS 486 â€¢ In a democratic society, the general goals and learning outcomes for 487 schools are established bv states and local communities. However, the 488 means to achieve these state and local goals are best determined by those 489 responsible for the implementation of the educational program at the local 490 school site. Teacher unions. as the collective voice of the teaching 491 profession, must be involved in the development and implementation of 492 education policy matters at all levels. \r\n493 â€¢ School faculty and staff must share in the establishment and maintenance 494 of school goais and values consistent with required state and local 495 education outcomes. \r\n496 â€¢ School site dutonomy must be increased, with greater decision-making 497 power invested in classroom teachers. \r\n498 â€¢ Schools should operate in: a collegial and participatory fashion under the 499 leadership of the teaching faculty. All building employees should be 500 recognized as contributing to the efficient operation of the school. \r\n501 LEADERSHIP \r\n502 â€¢ As progress is made in restructuring schools. the AFT supports an even 503 greater distinction than currently exists between the roles of teachers and 504 those who do not teach. Teachers should assum3 the appropriate 505 instructional and curricular functions currently exercised by those who do 506 not teach. \r\n507 â€¢ Teachers should be the instructional leaders of the schools and should be 508 responsible for making decisions about instructional strategies, staff 509 development. curricular materials. pupil assignments and scheduling, 510 structure of learning time during the school day, instructional goals 511 beyond those set by the state or local school board. school-level budgutary 512 matters. and elements of professional evaluation. \r\n513 â€¢ The role and function of managers in a learning-centered school mllst 514 continue to he explored. Different roles and models have been suggested: 515 1. teacher-run schools with a group of teachers taking on school site 51f> management responsibilities. employing an administrator to handle 517 the day-to-day administrati\\\'e tasks, which could include the 51H employment of managers from outside the field of education (see 3 \r\n:> 1!J below): \r\nII) \r\n\r\n,.. \r\n\r\n1 \r\n\'4 \r\n520 2. principal as institutional advocate who also serves as a liaison with 521 central governance bodies and the community. with teachers 522 empowmed to make decisions about and implement the instructional 523 and curricular functions of the school; 524 3. principal as building manager who implements the educational 525 program and school discipline policies designed by teachers and 526 carri.es out district and state reporting requirements. The principal is 527 generally responsible for working with personnel not directly involved 528 in the school instructional program and with the coordination of 529 student services provided by outside agencies. \r\n530 â€¢ Teachers\' salary levels should not be limited by the salaries paid 531 administrators. \r\n532 STRUCTURE \r\n533 If a group of experienced teachers were brought together and given the 534 opportunity to design a school structure from scratch. the chances of their 535 reaffirming the present structure would be remote. Beginning with the 536 isolated. cellular organization of classrooms on to the whole top-down. \"eggâ€¢537 crate\" structure of the typical public school. there is a series of obstacles to 538 effective teaching and learning. Present classroom arrangements. for 539 example. force teachers into spending most of their time lecturing and 540 maintaining order, and sometimes even require them to be entertainers rather 541 than teachers in order to hold the attention of their usually excessive number 542 of students. The professional ideals that drew teachers into teaching in the 543 first place-working intensively with students. preferably on a more 544 individual basis. intellectual challenge. cooperation. and control over oneÂ·sÂ· 545 work. to name but a few-are everywhere thwarted. 546 It is I itHe wonder. then. that such an alarming proportion of teachers 547 \"burn out.\" leave, or become cynical. For even under more enlightened 548 school administrations. the present school structure makes it difficult for 549 teachers LO function as full professionals on behalf of their students. In all too 550 many schools, it has become increasingly difficult for teachers to deploy 551 human. curricular. and technological resources within the school. as 552 necessary. to work with students individually or in groups. and to interact 553 with and learn from their colleagues. 554 The :..osts this factory-model school system imposes on students are also 555 considerable. Students learn in a variety of ways and through a variety of 556 means. and these patterns frequently vary even subject to subject. The 557 present structure takes little or no account of this. Students are individuals. 558 some of whom need intensive help from a variety of sO\'.lrces in order to attain 559 mastery. others of whom can function more independently. and most of 560 whom embody diverse needs. depending on the situation. The present 561 structure takes little or no account of this. Some students who could forge 562 ahead may be held back by the needs of the majority of their class or grade. 563 while others who encounter difficulties that might be easily detected and 564 rectified under a more flexible class. grade, and curriculum structure may be 565 left back unproductively and become tomorrow\'s dropouts. The present 566 structure takes little or no account of this. All students require problemâ€¢567 solving and critical-thinking skills. as well as basic skills. and prompt and 568 constructive feedback on\' school and homework assignments. The present 569 structure. with its fixed and excessive class sizes. takes little or no account of 570 this. . 571 The dysfunctional nature of the present structure has become increasingly 572 apparent to the AFT. This is evident from the massive defections of teachers 573 from the t~aching ranks and in the criticisms of those who remain. It is 574 evident in the staggering dropout and failure rates. particularly among 575 disadvantaged students. And it is evident in the low performance of average 576 and even gifted American students relative to their counterparts in other \r\n1 1 \r\n\r\n577 developed nations. \r\n578 Rethinking the present structure of schools is therefore an essential preâ€¢\r\n579 condition to the creation of learning-centered schools. The AFT recommends \r\n580 the following preliminary steps toward the realization of this goal: \r\n\r\n581 â€¢ Time is a key element in restructuring teaching and schools. Time for \r\n.....:.,.;-............. \r\n\r\n582 teachers to.teach. to plan. to continue learning. and to make educational 583 decisions requires alterations in current teacher loads and creative uses of \r\n.584 technology. paraprofessionals. and other instructiona~ personnel under the :\'-85\" direction of teachers. Current teaching loads therefore must be reduced 586 and restructured to achieve these goals. The prevailing principle should be 587 to improve. rather than diminish. students\' access to professional teachers. \r\n588 â€¢ In contrast to the current system in which students are assigned a new 589 teacher(s) every year. and ~n order to enhance teachers\' ability to make 590 appropriate instructional decisions for students and students\' prospects for 591 receiving individualized attention. the possibilities of new arrangements 592 should be explored. such a., having staff teams take responsibility. perhaps \r\n59:3 over periods of more than one year. for determining the instructional needs 594 of groups of students. providing appropriate follow-up. and monitoring 595 their progress. \r\n596 â€¢ Paraprofessionals involved in instruction must be well trained and 597 certified and given greater responsibility fol;\' working with students while 598 under the direction of teachers. \r\n599 â€¢ Learning-centered schools sho,:tld employ a variety of informational 600 technologies. includingvideo.~Â· audio. ami computing resources; however. 601 the use. assessment. and refinement of these reSOUrC0!i should be part of 602 the professional task or\'teachers. \r\n603 PROFESSIONAL OEVELOfMENT \r\nhOo; â€¢ Staff development should exist on a continuum beginlling with an 605 internship and continuing thFQ.ughout one\'s professional life. Continued 606 professional development ~hould be a normal job expectation and occur f)Oi \\\\\'ithin the regular school day. This could include regular reviews and 608 observations by colleag~es. demonstration te.aching. coaching. and \r\n609 opportunitie.s for cond\\,1cting independent research. \r\n610 EVALUATION \r\n611 â€¢ Beginning teachers should b~ assisted and assessed by experienced 612 teachers pri9,l\' to certificaUoll. \r\n613 â€¢ Following 1ll1plementaHon of high-quality teacher internship and 614 residency programs and when teacher-directed professional growth 615 opportunities are a regular part of the school program. peer assistance and 616 intervention should be used to safeguard standards withill the profession. \r\n617 â€¢ Intensive e\\\'ahlations of\' certified teachers should occur only .when serious 618 problems are evident. \r\nfll ~ ACCOUNTAijlLiTY IREGULATION \r\nH2O â€¢ In order to h(}lp ensure the establishment and maintenanCt~ of at least thn ti2l minimum conditions necessary for teaching and leafllin~ {t, occur. an 622 index of essentiallearning-illput conditions (such as tedchers teaching in 623 field. adequate teaching resources and supplies. up-to-date and adequatu 624 numbers of textbooks. etc .. etc.) should be developed and schools should \r\nf\")r:\r\n1_,) IH! pl1blich\' rated everv vear or two under the criteria established bv the ti211 indnx. Tilt} AFT shouid \'consider encouraging states to pass sllch Fair h2i LI!arning Conditions Acts. with rigorous state and local enforcement h28 pro\\\"isiolls. so that schools that consistently fall below the minimum \r\nJ) \r\n\r\n\" !

Central school system administration and state governments therefore should monitor the progress \'of schools. However. regulation and intervention should be applied to the school site only if the school fails to meet minimum learning-input standards outlined in an index ot essential conditions for a learning-centered school or other appropriate problem indicators. such as high teacher turnover. dropouts, violence, and poor student performance. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nThe autonomy of teachers in school sites is predicated upon norms and standards of practice established by the teaching profession. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROLE OF THE UNION \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nThe details of the various mechanisms described herein should be developed and implemented through the participation of teachers and through the collective bargaining process or memorandum of understanding at the local level or through a collaborative agreement. \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nCollective bargaining contracts should continue to allow for flexibility in mutually agreeable experimental programs at the school site. \r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC 	SCHOOL CHOICE \r\n648 Choice within the public schoqls exists in many forms: magnet schools, 649 alternative schools. schools within a school. open enrollment, and elective 650 courses, among others. The AFT recognizes, however. that for both parents and 651 teachers, current choices of educational programs may be unnecessarily limâ€¢652 ited, largely by the wealth of a district or the inflexibility of central or school 653 administration. The AFT therefore remains open to the discussion of choice 654 options within the public school system if such options fulfill the educational 655 conditions, goals. and outcomes duly established by states and local commllâ€¢\r\n656 nities. 657 Our openness is a cautious one, for we recognize the pitfalls of the choice 658 issue. even within the public school system. These pitfalls involve the need to 659 balance the public or social interest against individual interests and to avoid the 660 kind of racial. class, and ability segregation that is antithetical to the mission of 661 public schools in a democratic society. Any consideration of a public school 662 choice proposal must also be sensitive to the protection of the rights of teachers. \r\n13 \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROLE OF THE UNION \r\nL4 > \r\n\r\n663 Throughout its history. the AFT has recognized that unionism and profesâ€¢664 sionalism are ,inextricably linked. That basic precept has shaped our activities 665 and clarified the role that a union of professionals must play. The AFT 666 pioneered collective bargaining for teachers and other education employees. A 667 strong union structure has been established. an effective political action capacâ€¢668 ity developed. and considerable power and authority have been moved to our 669 members. 670 Through these means-collective bargaining. political action. and profesâ€¢671 sional development assistance-we have made significant achievements all 672 behalf of our members and have overcome tough obstacles in the face of difficult 673 conditions and changing requirements for public education. We will continue 674 to use and develop these means to bring about change and improvements in the 675 status and conditipns of teaching and to enhance the quality of education. And 676 we now have a special opportunity to build on our achievements and to advance 677 the teaching profession. 678 The American Federation of Teachers has a responsibility to playa signifiâ€¢679 cant role iIi the education reform movement. It is crucial that the quality and 680 level of education received by Americans be improved. As a union. we can make 681 an important contribution to assure that there will be sufficient numbers of 682 qualified teachers to teach America\'s children and that those teachers will have 683 professional authority over teaching practices. In fact. the unprecedented aUenâ€¢684 tion given to education at this time by governors. legislators. the business 685 community. and the public at large presents an opportunity to achieve gains for 686 our members and for public education that may not come our way again soon. 687 The AFT realizes that certain conditions must be met if we are to bp 688 successful in our obligation to represent members in their relationship with 689 management. protect the institution of public education in the environment in 690 which it t~xists. and protect the institution of democracy in America where w,~ 691 are privihJged to live and practice our profession. Consequently. the union\'s rolt~ 692 in education reform is an important part of the union\'s primary responsibility of 693 effectively representing its members. Past achievements were made possible 694 because hundreds of thousands of individuals who joined our union because o~ 695 a belief and a vision remained to build an organization capable of meeting the 696 challenge we now face. 697 We are about to experience the largest shortage of teachers in the history of 698 American education. Some of the first efforts at education reform have resulted 699 in overly prescriptive changes affecting professional conditions and discouragâ€¢700 ing the choice of teaching as a career. Pay and status in teaching. while showing 701 recent gains. remain below levels in other professions. To overcome the shortâ€¢702 age while resisting the erosion of professional standards. we must attempt 703 radical. rather than incremental. changes in the basic structure of American 704 education. ,\"_ 70S Our organizational g6alis to preserve public education while empowering 706 teachers to exercise independent professional judgment in educational matters. 707 This means we seek to restructure the present public education system and 708 obtain for teachers the legiti,mate authority to make decisions affecting their 709 work. We will not exchange one set of prescriptive controls for inflexible 710 working conditions established in any other manner. The union is a force in the 711 education system for the practicing professional because it represents and .712 asserts its members\' interests in improving the profession and the quality of 713 education. \r\n714 â€¢ The ;\\FT seeks to empower teachers to gain legitimate responsibility and 715 authority for teaching and the learning environment inthe schools. to retain 716 independent decision making in matters relating to the profession. and to \r\n\r\nf ~I 	717 assist in obtaining the resources needed to provide a high-quality education 718 program. The union welcomes proposals that can help achieve these goals. \r\n719 â€¢ The AFT should provide a forum for the exploration of developments in theÂ· 720 advancement of the profession and other aspects of education reform. conâ€¢721 sider national policies and responses related to these developments. and 722 provide research and staff support for affiliates. \r\n723 â€¢ The AFT should. at the same time. be involved in providing assistance for \r\n724 activities that will strengthen the capacity of state federations and local \r\n725 unions in efforts to organize and represent members. The AFT should assist \r\n726 in the establishment of union structures. provide for leadership training and \r\n727 assistance. and help our locals develop the skills and programs that they \r\n728 require to represent members and participate in the development and impleâ€¢\r\n729 mentation of education reform issues. \r\n730 Opportunities to advance the interests of members can take many forms. and \r\n731 we shouldbe open to these opportunities while we seek to develop our capacity \r\n732 to represent our members\' interests. The union consists of locals in various \r\n733 \'stages of development and maturity. Because of the different conditions and the \r\n734 \'variations of 	experience. some state federations and locals will necessarily \r\n735 choose different ways to advance the profession. At each level of governance. we \r\n736 should use the tools available to us-collective bargaining at the local level \r\n737 where possible. heightened political and legislative activity at the state level. \r\n738 and union-sponsored programs to enhance the profession. \r\n739 There are significant opportunities in the education reform movement for \r\n740 emerging locals and state federations. By being open to new ideas and involved \r\n741 in their development, drawing on the resources and experience of other segâ€¢\r\n742 ments of the union. locals can provide a stronger voice for their members. This \r\n743 involvement can result in important improvements in education and gains for \r\n744 :teachers and other school employees and can also help the union grow. The \r\n745 growth of the union is important to the education reform movement because qf \r\n746 \'the special relationship of the union to its members. Teachers and their unions \r\n747 will evaluate proposals. develop new concepts. and serve as the vehicles \r\n748 \'through which the new reform measures will be implemented. The most valuâ€¢\r\n749 able reform proposals are those that support these opportunities. \r\n750 The consideration of new ideas and involvement in education reform \r\n751 activities should enhance the efforts to strengthen our ability to represent \r\n752 members. In fact. such involvement may suggest the importance of organizing \r\n753 and prove useful in broadening our sense of purpose for the organization. As \r\n754 that strength is established. the union can effectively insist on the involvement \r\n755 or teachers in any activity relating to the profession and obtain. through bargainâ€¢\r\n756 jng or collateral activity. the conditions of employment sought by its members. \r\n757 At the same time. we must continue to target resources and efforts toward \r\n758 building strong local unions in neW areas. \r\n759 The following considerations should guide state federations and locals \r\n760 engaged in the development of education reform proposals: \r\n761 .. Teacher unions. as the collective voice of the teaching profession. must be 762 involved in the development and implementation of education policy matâ€¢763 ters at all governance levels. The union\'s role is to provide leadership through 764 informing and educating the membership about the latest developments in 765 education reform and by taking the initiative in suggesting new education 766 reform policies. \r\n767 â€¢ Participation of the membership in developing, deciding. planning. and 768 implementing reform proposals is critical to the acceptance of reform by 769 .\' members. The local. state. and national structures should encourage opporâ€¢770 ,~\" tunities for broad participation by members in the process. \r\n771 \'\'wI The collective bargaining process or collaborative agreements at the local 772 level and the legislative process at the state level are important means to rely 773 ;;~ on in the exploration and development of various reform proposals. \r\nIS \r\n\r\n774 â€¢ The discussion of reform proposals and the experience of other state federa-\'.. I 775 tions and locals can provide valuable insights to state and local federations 776 about new approaches that can help us achieve our goals. AFT locals and 777 state federations have gained experience in successfully bargaining new 778 measures to enhance teachers\' professional lives, as well as lobbying for 779 educational improvements at the state legislatures. We should make every 780 effort to firid ways to come together to share these experiences for the benefit 781 of all. \r\n782 â€¢ Members can benefit from efforts by state federations to bring together locals 783 to achieve state education reforms. The coordinating role of the state federaâ€¢784 tion is crucial in the political debate surrounding education reform issues. A 785 strong state federation program is imperative to ensure the ability of the union 786 to provide effective leadership in education reform. \r\n787 â€¢ State federations and local unions need to expand their political action 788 capacity so that reform activities requiring legislative activity or political 789 responses can be achieved. State federations and local unions are urged to 790 commit specific resources to achieve this goal. \r\n791 â€¢ In developing programs to explore and implement education reform. we need 792 not draw resources away from our present activities but, rather. develop new 793 resources to meet the needs of our membership as a consequence of reform 794 proposals. \r\n16 '),(4709,111,2,49,0,'Education'),(4710,111,2,41,0,'Network News for Urban Principals in New York'),(4711,111,2,39,0,'United Federation of Teachers'),(4712,111,2,48,0,'Academy for Educational Development,.

AFL-CIO, w\'elcomes the opportunity to present our vievlS on the Higher Educa.tion Act. As you knovJ) the AFT is the largest representative of college faculty members in the United States& Hore than 75,000 AFT members teach in onr NationVs colleges and universities and the AFT is the exclusive representative for the faculties of public systeLils in New York. Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania) New Jersey. Vermont~ as well as, representing individual colleges allover the Nation. \r\nThe actions contemplated by this Suhcor:.::n..i.ttee and the actions taken in the past have profound effect on the health and effectiveness of our higher education system. We note vlith apprecia tlon and respect the landmarks in higher education already achieved by you.r legislative work. \r\nThe Basic Education Opportunity Grants program has made a ~ollege education affordable for thousands of students ,;1ho might. not otherwise be able to pursue higher education and has eased the burden of middle-income families faced with choices bet\"lcen necessitiE:s and higher education.. Othe.r Gran.ts and the Loan program have cle?-rly provided the means for a college ed\'ucati.on to manyo And. v7hi1e we are not in favor of all aspects of the loan. program, \'(V\'e do acknm\\rledge a cont::i.J:luing necessity for loans in finaI?-cing higher education.. \r\nvIe. also com\'l;\'~nd the fine v70rk by this Subc.ommittee in 1976 with the estab-â€¢lishment of t.he teacher center program. I-1hile teacher center programs are still a small struggl:tng federal program, the concept is nOIY established and it i.s our hope that.in time these benefits can be extended to teachers all ov(~r the country. H.e kno,\\. that. this Subcol1!uittce shares that: goa1o \r\nTITLE I \r\nThe AFT has many higher education interests; it \"\'QuId be impossible to spell them all out no matter hOl;1 much time \'lYe had. For example, Life-Long Learning. The program) that :i.s currently on the books. has simply not attracted enough support ill. its cur;:ent forlll in part because of the massive pressures on the federal budget. We believe that an effective response to these pressures would be to create a pl:ogram that \",auld reach-out and tap the funds already availa~le nation--,vide for continuing education. Nany programs have been negotiated by unions to cover their members educational costs. Testimony given to the \r\n.\', \r\nPage 	Two \r\nHouse Education and Labor Committee indicates that there are at least 198 current plans in existence with more being negotiated each year and that these plans provide a potential of more than $200 million for this purpose. It is our belief that channelling this large amount of private sector dollars into a coherent plan will do more to advance life-long learning opportunities than anything currently on the books. It. can be esped.ally significant if such plans \",ere uncovered and publicized in conjunction with programs offered by existing educatiohal in~tit~tions. A small amount of federal seed money could be used to coordinate the putti.ng together of programs, dollars and students. \r\nAs \\vi th many other federal programs) a relatively small amount: of federal money can trigger benefits far out-of-proportion to the amount of federal investâ€¢ment. This is just a concept but we believe the Subconmd.ttee should examine it seriously as it begins its Reauthorization of Title I of the Righm.:-Edueation Act. \r\nWith regard to the student loan prmlisions of this 1(c~8islation~ \'V(~ would like to make it clear that vlh:Lle He support roost of the content of the current legislation as well as its intent (which we belteve is to increase educational opportunities for students) \'lye do so \',Tith some reluctance and one major pr:Lnclple obj cct:l0l.1o \r\nThis objection is based in th!:; exte:nt to which 8ue1l. loan programs offer incentives t.o the states and the i.nstitutions to incxease thei.r costs; e.ncour2.ge the notion that students bear even greater responsibility for their education E\'){perl.f::e~; than is now the. case; and therefore. drive clm\'ln enrollments aIHong those portions of our population which are in most need of hiGher education. namely ~ the ll.d.rt():ci ties and tl.w poor. \r\nThf\'~J:\'(:: has been much contradictory and often coafusing d;:1i~a offm:ed fl.g to the J:eal impact of fcde;:al [;tudent aid dollars alL the ac1lJev:~wer;.t of t:\'l12 goale; of equality of access and opportmdty VJithin higher education. Bec.ause of this, Fe full.y endorse the establishment of a \"National Commission on Student \r\n\'0, 	LOaIwli and urg(~ i:hai. t.he utmost c.ar(~ be given to assn)\':e that appoi.n.t:e\':::G to this body he representative of those constituencies most effected by tile spect~e of: [3pJx:;:;ling :.Lncrr:;:tses in college casU,. lye vlOulc1 [l{..;svme that tI,e first: ol\'dc,-of husine:\'3s of this Commission i.;rQuld be to mi:1k.e an aSSe;.:lSl.nent of the effect of this legislation upon students Leorn families of all income b:cackets, as \\\'Je11 as to develop a realistic definition of Hhat it eonst:itute:.; t.o he a tineedil Bt:udent in these inflationary t:lmec;. \r\nWe vlOuld also expect the Commission to develop mec.han:LslTls vlh~i.eh would encourage both the institutions and the states to maintain their current levels of support of student assistance pro8rams so as to insure that the entire burden of a student\'s educational cost do not become transferred to the student or the federal government in this entirety. In the interim. we support the maintenance of current programs as provided in this bill. We oppose steps to increase interest rates to loan users as a step toward student loans out of the reach of 100\\\'t:r--anc1 middl.e-Â·income families. \r\nThe American Federation of Teachers supports the full funding of student aid programs; the Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, Supplemental Educational \r\nPage Three\r\n.\' \r\nOpportunity Grants, Nat:1.onal Direct Student Loans, State Student Incentive Grants, College Work Study and Guaranteed Student Loans are essential: We especially support the phasing out of the \"half-cost\" provision of the BEOG VJhich \\>le feel discriminates against low-income students attending relatively low-cost public institutions as well as the increase in size of the maximum BEOG grant to $2700 by 1980. \r\nThe Urban Grant University Act is one of the most prolD...l..s:mg feder\'al lnitiatives :tn higher educationÂ·--and in solving the Nation r s urban pro\"blems 0 It would encourage colleges and universities to become intricately in.volved in assisting cities by applying their human and y-nowledge resources to the solution of urban problems and to the proffering of urban publicÂ·sc\\vlces. \r\nCategorical aid should be exte.nded rat.her than e.liminted.

Therefore, \",e suggest that changes that would signific,::;n.t1y alter the legislation should be scrutinized to determine their lonf\',-range \r\neffects. \r\nhie pr()pose a fiveÂ·Â·Â·year fundingÂ·-cye::lc for teacher center projects that would include. a one\'-year planni.ng period.. This recommendati.on is basc\'~d on the evidence collected from the teacher centers funded by the Teacher Center Program. The p1anni.ng year wi.ll provide time for policy lJOard members and the. directo)~\' of the project to de.velop a cooperative\'; Horking relationship and deslgn program activities that realistically meet the needs of the teachers in the service area. Many of the documented start-up problems that arose during the past year could have been avoided by this planning stage. \r\n, .. \r\n\r\nrage i\'our \r\nWe re.commend a five-year cycle to insure the time for institutionalization of the teacher center after federal support has emerged because of the collaborâ€¢ative efforts of teachers, administrators, university faculty and school board members. This unique element that exists in the governance structure of teacher centers must be given time in order to achieve a significant impact on teachers and students. \r\nThe extension from three to five years is not without precedent in federal programs. We point to the Teacher Corps Program as one example. Historically, districts have not placed in-service education on the list of priorities in the education budget, so we recognize the fact that a shift in emphasis must be given a reasonable length of time to hring about lasting results. Commitment to tea.cher in-service education and teacher centers v.Jill be insured if the positive effects are evident within a district and schools are turned around because of this success factor. \r\nIn line \\-lith these objectives, ,,,e also recollID1end that the fiveÂ·Â·Â·year funding period apply to the teacher center projects presently funded by the U.S. Office of Education, to insure the successful institutionalization of those projects already in existence. \r\nHe applaud. the f;ign.ificant contribution of the Te.\".cher Corps I\'rogr.:ull to the improvement of teache~ preservice and in-service c~ucation.

This group would not hav~ veto power. \r\nDuring the past decade~ the American Federat.ion of Teachers has su.pported the concept of an internship programÂ· that \\V\'ould provide assist2nCt~ to IW,Â·l teachers. It is in this same spirit that we propose that a new section be added to the Teacher Corps legislation that would prov:i.de funds for support for BEGIl~:r.t~g)1:ACHEr~. This support progr81H should serve the BEGINNING TEACHERS in the T(~<icher Corps Scl100l8 in particular because of the complex problems facing them in their ne\\V\' prof[~ssional role. He recommend further that this program be extended to other non-Â·Teacher Corps Title I Schools. BEGINNING TEACHF,],S in all Title I schools cOtlld be supported in their early professional development by such a program. \r\nPage Five\r\n. \' \r\nFunding would be used for released time [or consultation, work with experienced teachers in the teacher center and observation in classrooms managed by successful teachers. The project \\-JQulcl be guided by an Advisory Board which would include representatives from the school board, the teacher organization and institutions of higher education. Their function would be to act in an advisory capacity. \r\n-~ During this time of declining enrollment and greater stability among school staffs in elemen.tary and secondary schools, we recommend that the ratio of five experienced teachers to one should be changed to ten expr:!rieucpcl ,teac:hers to one rWI,j teacher. \r\nHe reeoJ11.lllcnd full funding for both Te;:J.c.lw.J:Â· Centers and the Teacher C01\'pS progrs.n.

(1978) \r\n\r\n73 \r\n\r\n3 EDUCATIONAL ISSUES \r\n\r\n84. EABLYCHILDHOOD EDUCA~IONPBOGBAMS \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, there is a nationwide need for univerâ€¢sally available child development services, and \r\nWHEREAS,centers for the education of pre-school through 2nd grade children in the 50 states are administered under various auspices, have widely disparate standards, and are frequently merely custodial where they exist at all, and \r\nWHEREAS, the American Federation of Teachers has always supported high quaJity standards in the education of children and working condiâ€¢tions of teachers, and \r\nWHEREAS, such centers should in all 50 states be administered by the State Departments of Eduâ€¢cation and/or locally by public school districts, similar to the Children\'s Centers in California and the Early Childhood Pre-School Centers in New York City; \r\nBESOLVED, that the American Federation of ~eachers support the concept of education of children under public school auspices with the. fOllowing quality components: \r\nl.uniformly high standards and coordination with existing public school education, a.fully licensed, trained paraprofessionals, and adequate ancillary personnel, 3.educationally desirable ratio of children to . teachers, 4.safe and healthful building and environment with adequate play space, a.family education programs and a high degree of parent involvement, 6.availabie to children of all parents, whether working, non-working, or student, 7.access to a tull range of health nutritionai, guidâ€¢ance and social services; \r\noEducated cit1zens make a greater contribution to . our Â·quaJityÂ· of life and to our country\'s well-being. Yet, instead of spending on education, instead of \r\nmaking a sound investment in the future, governâ€¢ments at every level are cutting back school budâ€¢gets. The inab1l1ty of the schools to maintain quaJiâ€¢ty programs results in immeasurable harm to our young people-and, in turn, weakens the fibre of our society. \r\nTruancy is increasing. \r\nDropouts are increasing. \r\nSchool violence and delinquency are increasing. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the general economic recession and the schools\' unmet needs create further problems: \r\nIncreasing numbers of young men and women enter the job market without required skills, and join the ranks of the unemployed. \r\nGrowing unemployment increases the numbers of children who come from disadvantaged homes. \r\nThe special needs of disadvantaged youngsters cannot be met by schools whose programs are inâ€¢creasingly cut back... \r\nThus the vicious cycle works itself out. Further, fiscal \"austerity\" actually saves no money. In fact, it costs more, for if government does not invest in jobs and education, it must spend much more-on welfare, unemployment insurance, prisons. For everyone m1llion people out of work the federal government loses $16 billion in revenue. There are further revenue losses to state and loc~l governments. \r\nThe nation must change-now-its course toâ€¢ward the neglect of human needs, toward Increasâ€¢ing unemployment ap.d poverty. AFT proposes, as one essential step tciwardbringing our economy back to health-a major investment in education from infancy through adulthood-Lifelong \r\nfurthermore, that the American Federation of .

(1971) \r\n\r\nThe name Educare has been replaced by Lifelong Learning -. \r\n85. LIFELONGÂ·LEABNING: AN OVEBVIEWÂ· \r\nIn this period of economic criSiS Americans oan and must look to the public school, as they have always done, for a way out of poverty and joblessâ€¢ness. Investment in education bears a fruitful return: . OEducated citizens make a greater financial conâ€¢\r\ntribution to the public economy. They earn more; they pay more taxes. \r\nOEducated Citizens consume fewer public services such as welfare, medicaid, unemployment insurance. \r\nhood education;:Â·\' .. \r\nOThere are approximately 16 m1llion working mothers, many of whom would need early childâ€¢hood education and/or day care services for their children; ........ \r\nOEight million unemployed adults need skills, r~â€¢. training, and countless more need and want education for a better, more rewarding life; \r\nOThousands of school age children\'are falling bElâ€¢cause classes are too large and teachers can\'t provide individualized instruction-yet there are twice as many candidates for teaching tha~ there are open positions; . \r\nOThousands of high school graduates are depriv:ed of higher education because they can\'t afford it, and because there aren\'t enough seats to go around. \r\nWe propose to meet these needs by a program of:Â· OUniversal early childhood education and child care, Within the public schools-to meet the \r\n\r\n69 \r\n\\. \r\n......... -. \r\n\r\n\r\n3 EDUCATIONAL ISSUES \r\n\r\nfrom providing day care under Head Start. They should continue to be excluded in any new early childhood and day care programs. \r\nTo meet America\'s need for a high quality early childhood education and child care program, the AFT calls upon the Congress to enact legislation that includes the following elements: l.Achievement as rapidly as possible of the goal of \r\nfree high-quality comprehensive early child care services for all children who need them. Since the program will necese\'U\'ily require a period of time to get fully underway, gradually increased funds should be provided toward earliest achievement of this goal. \r\n2;CoorcUnationby the public sChools as prime sponsor of a range of programs, including health, nutrition, counseling and other necessaâ€¢ry support services and child care in a variety of settings including family and group day care homes. \r\n3.Insistence that all services must meet federal reâ€¢quirements and standards as well as all local school and fac1l1ty codes and laws, and that all construction, renovation and repair undertaken under the program must conform to the prevailâ€¢\r\n. ing wage standards of the Davis-Bacon Act. 4.Deny1ng profit-making operators eligib1l1ty to receive federal funds. \r\n5.Provision for effective parent involvement in. these programs, Since they are programs parents voluntarily choose. \r\n6.Provision for proper certification and licensing of personnel and fOr tra.ining, retraining and inâ€¢service training o( professional and paraprofesâ€¢sional staff. \r\n7.Provision for full protection of the job rights and employment conditions of workers in child care programs. \r\nWe believe that high quality early childhood edâ€¢ucation and day care can help us begin to solve a number of our pressing social problems: it can reâ€¢duceunder-achievement; it can provide health and institutional care for those who Â·otherwise might not have it; it can bring parents closer to the schools; it can stimulate school integration by provic1ing quality programs at earlier ages. S~ch a program of education for the very young will beneâ€¢fit all of our citizens at every age. (1975) \r\n87. LIFELONG LEARNING II: \r\nA SECOND CHANCE FOR ADUL!r CI!rIZENS \r\n\r\nOur nation\'s adult citizens are in great need of educational opportunities. DMlliions of unemployed need training and \r\nretraining. \r\nDMlliions whO\' dropped out of high school or colâ€¢lege in their youths are now ready for a second chance. \r\nDMillions of workers seek the opportunity to change fields, or to advance themselves in their present jobs. \r\nDThere is a growing requirement for affirmative action programs in many of our industries, inâ€¢cluding education. Career ladder-type programs for women and minority group workers presentâ€¢ly segregated inlow paying, \"dead end\" jobs can meet that need. \r\nDEarlier retirement and increased leisure tim~ have created a need and a demand for educationâ€¢al experiences that improve the quality of life. \r\nDSenior citizens want and need programs to enâ€¢rich their lives, to enable them to use their minds and talents instead of wasting away their older years. \r\noPrisoners, long-term hospitalized persons, as well as other institutionalized individuals, could make a whole different life for themselves if eduâ€¢cation were made available to them. \r\nDAnd thousands upon thousands of young adults seeking post-secondary education are deprived of it by rising tuition costs. For every $100 inâ€¢crease in tuition, there is a corresponding deâ€¢crease in enrollments of between 2 and 3 percent. \r\nDThe public school 	system and our accredited higher education institutions are uniquely suited to meet these needs. They meet high qualâ€¢ity standards. They have the space, the qualified personnel, the know-how, the ability and expeâ€¢rience to work with industry and With the public sector in coordinating programs. \r\nAJ\"f propofl!es, therefore, a comprehensive proâ€¢gr~m,of adult: education which would include the foilowUig\' elements: ... . l.!ruilion costs at higher education institutions \r\nmust be reduced. \r\nI.Publicly supported grants, worker sabbaticals, and no-interest loans should be made available to every citizen who wants to resume or continue an education. We support a GI-biU type of proâ€¢gram for all those who have not had the opportuâ€¢nity to pursue their education. Such a program would reduce unemployment, increase availabiâ€¢lity of post-secondary education, and reduce welfare payments. l\'urthermore, it is non-inflaâ€¢tionary. It pays for itself.

LIJ\'ELONG LEABNIl\\IG m: \r\n~EACHEBIl\\I~EBNSBIP \r\nTeachers, unlike other professionals in our sociâ€¢ety, go immediately from a purely theoretical. acaâ€¢demic background in a college or university to their initial teaching positions without any signifiâ€¢cant on-the-job training. \r\nThere are now no true intern programs, only \"pseudo-progra.ms,\" few of which require previâ€¢ous preparation in teaching. Those which do reâ€¢quire prior preparation include only conventional courses plus student teaChing. \r\n\r\nThe result of the traditional approach to pre-serâ€¢vice education is that the problems of the beginâ€¢ning teacher are overwhelming. The early years of teaching are frequently the most turbulent, frusâ€¢trating, and painful ones. New teachers entering the classroom are confronted with staggering difâ€¢ficulties in immediately taking over full responsiâ€¢bilities, without proper preparation, and usually without support. In an elementary school, the teacher is responsible for 30 or more children all day for the entire year. In the secondary school, the teacher may face as many as 160 students in . five different classes each day all year long. These are the same aSSignments expected of an experiâ€¢enced teacher. Coupled with the pressures of extra-curricular aSSignments, young teachers beâ€¢gin their careers drastically undertrained and terâ€¢riblyoverburdened. \r\nThe result is that the teaching profession has an inordinately high dropout rate. An estimated 10 percent of the nation\'s trained personnel leave teaching each year, feeling that they have failed. Now that the teacher shortage is over, we have a unique opportunity to utilize available teachers and teacher candidates to develop a much-needed new plan for entrance into the profession and for the improvement of teacher training. The Ameriâ€¢can Federation of Teachers calls for the deyelopâ€¢ment of a genuine internship, one that would occur in reall1fe teaching Situations, similar to those in other professions. \r\nNo teacher should become permanently certified \r\nor be given full charge of a classroom unless and \r\nuntil a program of internship has been completed. \r\nSpecifically, beginning teachers should go through a period of up.to three years where they do not have full responsibility for a classroom. OVer that period of time they should have the opportunity to work with experienced teachers who would demâ€¢onstrate various teaching styles and methodoloâ€¢gies, exposing the interns to different curricular approaches and providing them. with continuous feedback. Other activities in which interns should be engaged are observations at all levels, attenâ€¢dance at school board meetings, working with other school personnel such as guidance counselâ€¢ors and social workers, and participation in curâ€¢riculum development. The internship program, inâ€¢volving cooperation with colleges and universities, would also enable experienced teachers to work along with researchers and other colleagues in higher education in important needed research in teacher effectiveness. \r\nFurther, we support the posit10ns that: \r\nDThe internship per10d should be preceded by a well-defined, systemat1c program of undergradâ€¢uate training in the knowledge and skills of teaching. \r\noThe regular teacher with whom the intern works must be given suffiCient time and support to work with those under his or her supervis10n. \r\nDColiege and un1versity programs also should be )\r\n\r\nconcerned with the preparation of supervisory \r\npersonnel and experienced classroom teachers \r\nwho work with interns. \r\n\r\nDTeacher centers should be established which would serve research needs as well as the needs of teachers on the development of their teaching skills and of experienced teachers in their conâ€¢tinuous in-service growth. \r\nDUnder no circumstances would interns replace regular teachers. DThe salaries of interns would be negotiated by the local teacher union. \r\nDAn initial preparatory\' certificate would be \r\ngranted to admit the intern for a probationary \r\nperiod of two years. At the conclusion of this \r\nperiod, permanent certification would be grantâ€¢\r\ned to qualified teachers. \r\n\r\n!fhis kind of meaningful teacher internship proâ€¢gram is vitally needed to improve teacher training, and uUimately to improve instruction in our naâ€¢tion\'s classrooms.

A~: \r\nMemo to Greg Humphrey June 16, 1981 -Page 2 \r\nFederally funded Teacher Centers and Teacher Corps programs are the only major exception. All that is left to fill the void are some one-to two-day anachronistic systemwide inservice days. It is impossible to meet individual personal growth needs through this type of program. \r\nGreg, I learned the hearing was canceled here. Our general argument, based on what has already been stated, is: \r\n1. 	\r\nThe Teacher.Center and Teacher Corps programs should remain at the federal level; the Teacher Center program should be moved into the Office of Professional Development at the Education Department, which is where Teacher Corps already is. This Office has as its responsibility to consolidate all federally-funded education programs and to help avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. \r\n\r\n2. 	\r\nWithout maintenance of these two programs there will be no capacity to develop model training programs at the federal level. SEAs and LEAs are unlikely to share successful practices because there\'s nothing in it for them. \r\n\r\n3. 	\r\nTeacher Corps is one of the very rare federal programs which has an urban focus. It is well-known that many of the state legislaâ€¢tures are controlled by rural areas and the cities, with large numbers of disadvantaged, handicapped and minority students, go begging. \r\n\r\n4. 	\r\nTeacher Centers can hardly be union hiring halls. Most have only one director. Even the largest have relatively few staff. As the LEA is the fiscal agent, it has final say over who the policy board, which again is made up of a diverse group of people includâ€¢ing administrators, teachers, parents, and higher education representatives, hires. \r\n\r\nTeachers support them not for personal gain but because the concept has produced recognizable results. \r\n\r\n5. 	\r\nThe California Department of Education says Teacher Centers have raised student achievement scores in schools the centers serve. Our experience in New York City and elsewhere is that this has been the case but we don\'t have the data to actually prove it yet. \r\n\r\n6. 	\r\nOverall, the argument on Teacher Centers is that few federal1yâ€¢initiated programs have been so successful or so cost-effective. Now that they have stabilized, they were just ready to institutionâ€¢alize. Documentation of process had taken place (75% of all center activities are related directly to classroom instruction) but evaluation data had not yet been coll~cted to provide the hard statistics on effects. Now they are vulnerable to the budgetâ€¢cutter\'s ax not because they failed but because the rug is being pulled out just as they had emerged as an entity (over three .y~ars)Â· which could be evaluated. \r\n\r\n\r\nMemo to Greg Humphrey June 16, 1981 -Page 3 \r\nIf there\'s anything at all which could be done to keep these programs at the federal level, Teacher Centers in particular, it would be of great value \r\nto do so. There\'s start from scratch deve10pments--good  a lot riding on professional development. or bad.  on  this and much  to be lost.

Y. Robart Jr. \r\nIn response to the article, \"Why It\'s So Hard to Fire Bad Teachers,\" in the May 8 issue of the Newsâ€¢day Magazine: \r\nFirst, it should be understood that the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) does not want schools to hire, grant tenure to or retain \'1lad\" teachers. That would serve no one well: Not the students, their parents, the schools, the administrators, the teaching profession, the union, and certainly not the community. The quesâ€¢tion, then, is not whether bad teachers should be reâ€¢tained, but how to determine whether a teacher is bad. \r\nThe Unit!!d Stata grants its citizens the right to due process; an American is innocent of whatever he or she is accused of until guilt is proved. The burden of proof is on the accuser, and there is a specific.process by which innocence or guilt is determined. \r\nIn the case of a teacher in New York State, that right, that protection, is embodied in the tenure law; and the process governing teacher disciplinary hearâ€¢ings is referred to as 3020 (A). Tenure is much misunâ€¢derstood. It does not guarantee lifelong employment. It does not mean a teacher never can be fired. \r\nTenure assures that a teacher cannot be dismissed \r\nwithout just cause, which must be established through \r\ndue process. Cause for dismissal (or lesser penalties) \r\ncan be incompetence, immorality, neglect of duty or \r\nseveral other specific failings. But the cause must be \r\nproved. Thus, a teacher is protected from dismissal for \r\nother reasons, such as a personal conflict with his or \r\nher principal, or complaints from a disgruntled parent \r\nwith unproved allegations who has gotten the ear of a \r\nschool board member. \r\nThe system of due process sometimes works slowly, \r\nas do other American justice systems. When a 3020 (A) \r\ncase drags on for weeks or months, it is fruStrating to \r\nall concerned, especially the teacher under the cloud of \r\nunproved allegations; NYSUT supports efforts to imâ€¢\r\nprove the process and reduce costs caused by unnecesâ€¢\r\nsary delays. But\"we never will seek such reforms at the \r\nexpense of either due process or justice. Given a choice \r\nbetween expensive, drawn-out justice and a quicker, \r\ncheaper system which may deny an individual that \r\nright, we\'ll choose the former-and so will other fairâ€¢\r\nminded Americans. \r\nThe fact that due process sometimes is lengthy \r\ndoesn\'t diminish the value of the law. The process stabiâ€¢\r\nlizes faculties, improves morale and -contrary to the \r\nimplications of the article -contributa to New York\'s \r\nposition ofleadership and excellence in education. Even \r\nthose who would like to modify the process support it. \r\nEducation Commissioner Gordon Ambach has been outâ€¢spoken in: his support of the concept of tenure. \r\nOur files have numerous examples of a teacher\'s reputation and career being saved when a 3020 (A) hearing resulted in dismissal of charges and affirmaâ€¢tion of innocence. I cannot offer specific names and places because 3020 (A) rightly provides for removal of such charges from a teacher\'s record when those charges have not been proved. For every instance cited in the article of the difficulty in getting rid of the acâ€¢cused \"bad\" teacher, there are several instances of the same process exonerating a teacher of charges stemâ€¢ming from unfair and untrue accusations. .. \r\nThere is another point to consider regarding the length oftime that disciplinary hearings often require. The school district has as long as it wishes to prepare its case against a teacher before it files charges. The accused teacher, then, should not be forced to respond in a short time to what often are very complicated charges covering an extended period. \'. \r\nTo return to my original statement, NYSUT does not want \"bad\" teachers in our schools. What can be done to lessen the possibility of ill-prepared or unqualiâ€¢fied teachers reaching the classroom? We believe the process of prevention should begin earlier -before any situation reaches the point of having to get rid of an incompetent teacher. .\' \r\nMuch greater care should be taken in preparing, \r\nhiring, and evaluating teachers. Teachers want that \r\nkind of quality control. The schools and the administraâ€¢\r\ntors want it. The public should demand it. \r\nNYSUT strongly supports higher standards in \r\nteacher education at the college and university level; \r\nwe support higher standards for admission to the teachâ€¢\r\ning profession; we support more comprehensive evaluaâ€¢\r\ntions that are constructive and promote professional \r\ndevelopment. . \r\nThen, after a teacher has been adequately trained, \r\nhired for a probationary periOd, thoroughly evaluated \r\nand granted tenure, the burden ofproof rightly belongs \r\non the employer to demonstrate why that individual \r\nsubsequently should be fired. Higher standards all \r\nalong the line would result in far fewer \"bad\" teachers \r\never reaching the classroom. \r\nNYSUT is not in the business of protecting \'\'bad\'\' \r\nteachers. We are, however, in the business of guaranâ€¢\r\nteeing that all tenured teachers receive due process \r\nand justice. We are in the busineSti of making sure \r\nthat no one is railroaded out of a career. We are in \r\nthe business of protecting the assumption of innoâ€¢\r\ncence unless guilt is proved through a sometimes \r\nlengthy, but necessary, process. \r\nAnd we make ~oapologies for beinginthat business. \r\nThomas Y.

Committee and the Boston Teachers Union \r\n\r\n1 The Contract between the Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO (the \"Union\") and the School Committee of the City of Boston (the \"Committee\") effective from September 1, 1986 through August 31, 1989 is \'amended as set forth below. The amended Contract shall be effective from September 1, 1989 through August 31, 1992, provided that it is ratified by both parties ana that the City Council of the City of Boston votes a supplemental appropriation to the budget of the Boston School Department sufficient to fund the Contract for the first year. \r\n2 The last two lines of the fourth paragraph of the Preamble shall be amended to read: \"relief from non-teaching tasks, all matters related to school-based and zoneâ€¢based management, and an increasingly effective curriculum.\" \r\n3 A new Article III of the Contract shall be inserted immediately following Article II, and subsequent Articles shall be renumbered accordingly. The new Article III shall read as follows: \r\nARTICLE III \r\nSCHOOL-BASED l\\1ANAGEMENT AND SHARED DECISION MAKING \r\n\r\nA. -Governing Philosophy \r\nThe Boston Teachers Union, the School Committee of the City of Boston, and the Superintendent of Schools agree that shared decision making at the school level is a goal to be achieved in the Boston Public Schools during the implementation of this collective bargaining agreement. \r\nShared decision making is a process in which all members of the education community at the school level collaborate in identifying problems, defining goals, formulating policy, and implementing programs. \r\nThe purpose of shared decision making is to create a climate in the schools where the faculty, parents, administration, students (at the high school level), and other community participants working together share the responsibility for school improvement, better student performance, increased \'satisfaction among professional educators, and greater commitment to and involvement with parents and the broader community. \r\n1 \r\nThe parties agree that Principals and Headmasters are the educational leaders at the school site. The Buildina Administrator is a key person in creating the environment necessary to brina about positive chance. The Principal, Headmaster, and Teachers share with the School Site Council (where such is established) the responsibility to create an environment where learnini and teaching are enhanced. \r\nThe parties recoanize the most important interactions that affect student performance take place daily between teachers and students. Teachers, therefore, must be given a shared voice in decisions at the school site. The parties recognize that with this increased role in the decision making process the teachers at the school site assume more responsibility for the success of the school \r\nThe parties recognize that parental involvement is essential to achieving success in school-based management. Therefore, parents shall be given a voice in decisions at the school site. \r\nThe parties realize that in order to achieve shared decision making at the school level a significant restructuring of schools must occur; and the parties agree to work cooperatively in an effort to bring about these necessary changes. Significant changes in the governance of school organization, instructional practices, staff roles, and community involvement will take time; they will not be accomplished in a single year; and the task will require a sustainedÂ· commitment from the leadership of the Union, the School Committee, and the Superintendent of Schools. \r\nB. Union-Management Committees \r\n1. Steering Committee \r\nA joint Union/School Department Steering Committee will be established to oversee the formation and operation of all other committees established under this Agreement to further school reform and improvement, including the School-Based Management Committee, the Professional Development Committee, and the Mentor Committee, as well as all School Intervention Teams. This Steering Committee shall be composed of the Superintendent of Schools and the President of the Boston Teachers Union, assisted by up to five additional members each. Decisions of the Steering Committee shall require the concurrence of the Superintendent and the President of the Union. \r\n2 \r\n\r\n2. School-Based Management Committee \r\nA joint Union/School Department School-Based Management Committee will be established to develop policies and guidelines on school-based management and to oversee their implementation. This Committee shall consist of up to five members appointed by the Superintendent and five members appointed by the President of the Union. It shall submit its recommendations to the Steering Committee for approval, and implement such policies as the Steering Committee directs. The Committee shall endeavor to operate by consensus as a role model to school-based decision making groups. Any deadlocks shall be reported to the Steering Committee. \r\nThe Union and the School Department recognize that the provisions of this agreement reflect a tentative consensus on a direction to move in reforming the schools. Both sides recognize that schoolâ€¢based management represents a new way of doing business with which they have limited experience. Success is likely to require much flexibility and learning from experience. Therefore the School Department and the Union agree to work together through the cpurse of this contract period to assess and improve this structure for school-based management in light of experience. \r\nC. Orientation Program on School-Based Management \r\nThe School-Based Management Committee will be responsible for creating an orientation program on school-based management for presentation during the 1989-1990 school year to all staff and interested parents and high school students. \r\nD. Adoption of School-Based Management \r\nHenceforth, each school in the system may choose to adopt school-based management whenever the Principal/Headmaster and 60% of the teachers at that school so agree. Once adopted, the Principal/Headmaster, teachers, parents, and students (in high schools) should elect representatives for a School Site Council to serve as the school\'s governing committee. The Union and Management believe that School Site Councils will not succeed if any constituency groups are left out of the process, therefore each group must endeavor to elect individuals who are representative of the ethnic diversity of their constituents, and the School-Based Management Commi!ttee will strongly encourage this. \r\nE., ~hool Site Councils; \r\n1. Composition \r\nSchool Site, CouncilS. at schoolS. adopting school-based\' management shall be composed as\' follows:, \r\nSmall Elementary Large Ele.mentary High SchoolS, SchoolS/Middle Schools Schools \r\nPrincipall \r\nHe,admaster 1 1 1 Teachers 5 6 7 Parents, 3 4 4 Students Jl .Jl _1 \r\nTotal 9 11 13. \r\nSchool Site. Councils may also, have associate,. nonvoting, members, for example additional. high, school students, and other re,presentatives from the\" business or university community. \r\n2. Mandate \r\nThe role of: a School Site Council is to manage: all matters that relate. to the operation of the s,chool\" including priority and: objective setting, design of the instrudional program, budgeting: and fundraising, purchasing and disbursement of, funds, space, utilization, hiring, of new staff and in-transfer of staff from other schools in, the system, selection and, guidance of mentor teachers, parent-teacher relations and functions\" solicitation and use of outside professionals and social s,ervice resources, and so, OIL, To the: extent\" possible, the: Council should. s,erve, as the School Improvement, Council for the disbursement of Chapter 188 funds and. any\' similar functions that may arise. )TheÂ· Council might not replace \r\n0\' er\' e e \" es\" suc as e, ,arent Council or\' Faculty \r\n~_enate, which, if they continue to operate, may be asked to deal directly with the Council, to advise it formally through their member representatives, or perhaps to\' merge with, it for: sele,cted purposes. \r\nEach, School Site Council is responsible. fOf:: finding ways to implement the intent of thc-previSions gpveming school-based: management in ways that do not violate-outs,tanding court\' orders. \r\n4 \r\n\r\n3. Operation \r\nIt is expected that a School Site Council should operate by consensus, where lack of agreement is viewed as a signal that the best option has not yet been developed and put forward. \r\n\r\nPrincipal/Headmaster is required to account in writing and in person (at a subsequent meeting) for any vote in contravention of a majority of the Council. In the event that a school has no sitting or acting Principal/Headmaster, the Zone Superintendent or his or her designee shall be substituted. \r\nUnless agreed otherwise by the Council: \r\n; \r\n(a) \r\nA majority of a Council\'s members shall constitute a quorum, provided that the Principal/Headmaster, at least two teachers, and a parent are present. \r\n\r\n(b) Meetings shall be held at least monthly. \r\n\r\n(c) \r\nMeetings shall be chaired by the \r\nPrincipal/Headmaster or his or her designee. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Training \r\nRepresentatives chosen to serve on School Site Councils will receive training (arranged by the School-Based Management Committee) beginning in the 1989-1990 school year that involves concept-and skillâ€¢building in at least the areas of team-building; collaborative, jointg problem-solving-style negotiation; parental involvement; and decisionâ€¢making by consensus. \r\n5. Dispute Resolution \r\nIn the event that a School Site Council reaches a deadlock on some important issue or repeatedly fails to reach consensus on issues, any three membersÂ· may request that the Zone Superintendent designate a facilitator or facilitators to help improve the Council\'s process. All members of a Council are obligated to cooperate in good faith with any such facilitation. \r\nIn the event that facilitation is requested, the Union and the School Department recommend that the Zone Superintendent seek facilitators from among, the members of a School Site Council (or Councils) that is functioning. well in the same Zone. \r\nF~ School Stamng \r\n1. \r\nDecisions on the, voluntary in-transfer of teachers, the hiring of new teachers for \"real\" vacancies, and consistent with the terms of the current contract the choice of teachers from the excess pool will be made by a Subc,ommittee of the School Site Council composed of two teachers, one parent, and the Principal/Headmaster, with a majority required for decision and with the Principal/Headmaster voting with the majority. Teacher and parent representatives on this subcommittee may designate temporary replacement representatives appropriate to the position being filled. \r\n\r\n2. \r\nA school that has adopted school-based management and formed a School Site Council may make decisions, on the voluntary in-transfers of teachers without regard to teacher seniority. In the event that the School Site Council is unable to reach a decision, the current contract provision shall apply. \r\n\r\n\r\nG. Legal and System Requirements; Waivers \r\n1. \r\nIn managing the school, the School Site Council must: comply with all applicable federal and state. laws, regulations, and court orders, unless the school has sought and received a proper waiver from appropriate authorities. The School Department and the Union will cooperate through the School-Based Management Committee in efforts to seek appropriate waivers of state or federal policies or regulations or to seek statutory change. \r\n\r\n2. \r\nA School Site Council may seek waivers from School Department regulations and School Committee policies. Waivers of School Department regulations are. at the discretion of the Superintendent. Waivers of School Committee policy must be approved by the School Committee. \r\n\r\n3. \r\nTo the extent allowed by law~ a, School Site, Council may seek a waiver of any provision of this collective\" bargaining Agreement, provided that 60% of the affected group covered under this Agreement vote in favor of seeking a waiver. Such waivers must be approved by a majority UAt~t a Union membership meeting and by, a majority vote of the School Committee, if required~ The Union agrees that, barring extraordinary circumstances, each request for a waiver oJ this Agreement \r\n\r\n\r\n6 \r\nwill be put to such a vote within 4S days of the request (excluding school vacations). \r\n4. The School Based Management Committee will develop a proc~ss for facilitating requests for waivers. \r\nSCHOOL ASSESSMENT \r\nA. Annual Education Plans \r\n1. Scope \r\ni \r\nBeginning no later than June 1, 1990, each school in the Boston Public School system must adopt a written Annual Education Plan that sets specific educational goals for the following school year, plans for meeting those goals, including budgetary requirements and contingencies, and proposed measures of success by which to gauge the achievement of the specified goals. The development of this plan is the responsibility of the School Site Council in schools that have one, or the Principal/Headmaster in schools that\' do not. \r\n2. Approval \r\nEach school\'s proposed Annual Education Plan must be submitted no later than June 1 of the prior school year to the Zone Superintendent. The Zone Superintendent, in consultation with the Zone Improvement and Planning Council, will either approve the plan or return it for revision. Any plan not approved or returned for revision wi~in 60 days of submission will be deemed approved. If a plan is returned for revision, the Zone Superintendent shall provide a detailed written explanation of this decision and specific recommendations for revision of the Plan. The school will then have 30 days to submit a revised Plan. If a school and the Zone Superintendent cannot agree on an appropriate Plan by October 1 of the covered year, the various proposed drafts and comments thereon shall be submitted to the Steering Committee (or the School-Based Management Committee, if the Steering Committee so designates), which will review them and develop a Plan at the school for that year. . \r\n3. Content \r\nThe School Department and the Union recommend the following goals for possible inclusion in a school\'s Annual Education Plan: \r\n-Improvement of reading scores \r\n7 \r\n-Improvement of math scores -Reduction of drop-out rate -Reduction of discipline and behavioral problems -Reduction of retention rates -.Improvement of student attendance -Improvement of teacher attendance -Improvement of student recruitment -Increased enrollment under the Student Assignment Plan -Retention of minority students (in exam schools) -Increase in racial balance -Increase in parent involvement -Reduction in suspension ra~es -Improvement in bilingual student achievement -Improvement in special needs student achievement -Increase in mainstreaming of bilingual students -Increase in mainstreaming of special needs students -Improvement in special education compliance -Improvement in meeting bilingual education requirements -Improvement of staff training programs -Improvement in student evaluations of school -Improvement in parent evaluations of school performance and \r\nclimate -Improvement in teacher evaluations of school -Improvement in student writing samples -Increase in participation in extracurricular activities -Meeting budget -Acquisition of increased extra-budgetary assistance \r\nB. School Performance Assessment \r\n1. Collection or Data \r\nPerformance-related data will be collected annually on all schools around a variety of system-wide and school-based criteria. Those measures which are applied system-wide shall be determined by the School Based Management Committee based initially on the report of the Boston Compact Measurement Committee. They may include, among other criteria: \r\nachievement test scores drop-out rates retention rates rate of students requesting transfer to other schools growth/attrition of enrollment under the student assignment plan rate of requested teacher transfers in and out \r\n8 \r\nstudent discipline parent, student, and staff satisfaction surveys \r\n-. 	percentage of eligible students who take achievement tests rate of growth in achievement rate of attendance (adjusted for unusual circumstances, such as a student or teacher\'s long-term absence due to illness): > students > staff \r\nAdditional criteria may be applied to a particular school in line with that school\'s Annual Education Plan. \r\n2. 	Annual Assessment \r\n. Schools will be assessed annually, comparing performance to goals, beginning in June, 1990. \r\nSchools whose performance is unsatisfactory will be responsible for detailing a plan for improvement in their next Annual Education Plan. In addition, schools whose performance is evaluated as unsatisfactory.by the Zone Superintendent based upqn the criteria established by the School Based Management Committee and the school\'s Annual Education Plan would be subject to review and assistance by a School Intervention Team that could recommend appropriate improvement measures, including but not limited to: \r\n-additional time to attempt improvement, but not more than one year -intensive monitoring -assignment of part-time or full-time in-school specialists or consultants -specialized staff development -reallocation of staff duties -replacement of some or all of the leadership team -reassignment of some or all BTU-member staff \r\nSchools whose performance is unsatisfactory can also request intervention from a School Intervention Team to help them formulate and implement an improvement plan. \r\nc. 	School Intervention Teams \r\nThe School Intervention Team will be composed of three members chosen by the BTU and three members selected by the Zone Superintendent and appointed by the Superintendent. This committee will work with the school administration, staff, and parents to formulate an improvement plan. \r\n9 \r\n\r\nRecommendations of the School Intervention Team are reached by majority vote and are subject toÂ· approval by the Zone Superintendent. If, after a year of intervention, the Team deadlocks 3-3 on a proposal for staff reassignment oÂ·f an unsatisfactory school, that ~hool will have an additional probationary year to attempt improvement following whatever guidelines on which the Team can agree. In addition, a new S.chool Intervention Team will be appointed or assigned to that school, and a seventh member added who is jointly agreed to by the Superintendent and the President of the BTU. \r\nNo reassignment of personnel can be recommended before June, 1992. \r\nThe School Based Management Committee will develop a program of positive incentives for improved school performance and rewards for continued excellence in school performance. \r\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT \r\nA. Professionalization \r\n1. 	ProCessional Development -a) Preamble. One crucial factor in creating and maintaining an \r\nexcellent public school system is the professional development of teachers and paraprofessionals. \r\nWhile the major responsibility for defining, developing, and implementing a plan for professional growth lies with the individual teacher or paraprofessional, the School Department and the Union agree that it is in their best interest to work together to facilitate, support, and provide resources and opportunities for teachers to exercise that responsibility. Professional development will increase teacher effectiveness, confidence, morale, commitment, and ability to improve the quality of education offered to students in the Boston Public Schools. Professionalization will also improve the School Department\'s ability to attract, develop, and retain excellent teachers. \r\nb) Definition. Professional development is the process by which teachers, individually and jointly, increase, enhance,improve, and update their existing knowledge base and skills. \r\nc) Structure and Content. The central issues that should determine the structure and content of professional development opportunities are what teachers, mentors, and evaluators identify as needs and as the most effective, efficient way to meet those needs. The rangeÂ· of possibilities for \r\n1D \r\nstructure and content of teacher professional development might include such items as: > granting teachers a sabbatical to pursue an advanced degree program at a university or college > providing staff support and resources for a teacher-designed, \r\nschool-based workshop held on a single afternoon > zone-sponsored mini-sabbaticals spread over several months > exchange programs for math, science, and computer teachers with \r\nbusiness, industry, and government \r\n> 	courses or seminars designed and tailored to respond to needs identified by Boston teachers and offered at school sites around the city \r\n> courses, seminars, and workshops available over educational television. > ip-school collaboration for a period of weeks or months with a specialized professional \r\nd) The Agreement. The Committee and The Union agree to establish a seven-member Professional Development Committee to facilitate, develop, conduct, and support professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals. \r\nThe Professional Development Committee will study the following issues and others related to the development of professionals in the schools, and develop recommendations and plans for implementation, including plans for raising external funding where it may be available. These recommendations and a plan for implementation by March, 1990, will be presented to the Steering Committee. If approved by the Steering Committee, it is expected that the Professional Development Committee\'s recommendations will then be implemented as soon as possible: . \r\na) Reduction in the burden on teachers of non-teaching tasks \r\nand paperwork; \r\nb) Improving the system-wide access of teachers to computers; \r\nc) Improving the availability of telephones to teachers to \r\nfacilitate communication with parents. \r\n\r\nOn the following issues, it is expected that the Professional Development Committee\'s recommendations will be implemented in the second year of the contract provided funding is available (money for general school purposes or external funding): \r\nd) A professional development institute along the lines of tile Schenley model (a teacher learning center), equipped with appropriate resources including professional literature; e) A career development program for parapr-ofessionals supportive of their attaining teacher certification f) \"Reduced-\" or \"no-cost\" courses for teachers. \r\n11 \r\nOn the following issues it is expected that the School Department will budgetÂ· funds to implement the Professional Development Committee\'s recommendations (as approved): \r\ng) Recruiting current high school students as future teachers \r\nin the Boston Public Schools; \r\nh) Job sharing, which will be implemented iii the second year \r\nof the contract, at least up to some cost ceiling to be determined. \r\n\r\nOn the following issues, which are expected to have relatively . little economic impact on the School Department budget, it is expected that the Professional Development Committee\'s recommendations will be implemented as approved: \r\ni) Assistimce and cooperation for teachers in seeking outside \r\ngrants for creative approaches to the teaching task; \r\nj) The Business Exchange Program; \r\nk) Peer teaching (co-counseling). \r\n\r\n2. Sabbaticals \r\nThere will be 35 sabbaticals (or the dollar equivalent in part-time sabbaticals) in the first year of the contract as previously agreed. In the second and third years of the contract there will be either 35 sabbaticals or an equivalent expenditure for a professional development option recommended in the alternative by the Professional Development Committee. \r\nParaprofessionals shall be eligible for sabbaticals beginning in the 1990-91 school year. \r\n3. Educational Conference Days \r\nThere will be 2000 days annually across the system budgeted for educational conference days that may be used for educational conferences, for visiting other schools locally, for teacher conferences, and for similar professional activities. The Professional Development Committee will be responsible for determining how such days will be allocated among schools. \r\n4. Performance Evaluation \r\nThe Professional Development Committee shall also be responsible for developing a revised performance evaluation tool and process by April, 1990. The performance tool is expected to include a \r\n12 \r\nfour..grade rating system, unless the Committee agrees on an approach they feel is better. The current evaluation system shall remain in place for the 19890 1990 school year. Teachers receiving an \"Excellent\' evaluation during the 1988Â·1989 school year will next be reviewed in 1990..1991. Provisional teachers will continue to be evaluated annually. \r\nMENTO RING \r\na) Preamble. The Committee and the Union agree iliat a mentQring system to provide support. and training for new teachers and a structured system for veteran teachers to continue to gain and share expertise is an essential goal for developing excellence in the Boston Public Schools. \r\nb) DefinitioBie Mentoring is the process by which a practicing member of the profession who has demonstrated excellence in the profession and can, with training share that expertise with others, offers structured training and support to members of the profession. \r\nc) The Agreement. The Committee and the Union agree on the establislunent of a. new position entitled \"Mentor Teacher.1\'I \r\n1. Mentor Committee \r\nA Mentor Committee will be established to design the job description and operating model for mentor teachers, and to select such teachers. This seven-member committee will be composed of four teachers appointed by the Union and three members appointed by the Superintendent. Recommendations of the committee require at least five votes in favor to send them to the Educational Reform Steering Committee for approval. The committee\'s goal is to implement a mentoring program as soon as possible, with a target of January, 1990. \r\nTeachers will apply for the position. Once selected, they will be\' provided appropriate training for the role. \' \r\nMentor teachers will be school-based to the extent possible, supplemented by zone-based mentors as needed. There will be flexibility and input at the school level about how the program is implemented at that school. \r\nThe mentoring program will aim to establish a one-to-one relationship between a mentor teacher and all newly hired teachers. In the first year of the contract, mentor teachers will be provided to all new elementary teachers and new teachers in one pilot middle school \r\nand high school Full implementation in middle and high schools will be phased in over the second and third year of the contract. Mentor teachers from different s.chools will meet together several times during the year to share ideas and experience. \r\nMentor teachers will have appropriate released time during the school day and will use additional time after school and before and after the school year in accord with the working model designed by the Mentor Committee. They will receive a salary supplement of 1/10 of their ten-month salary. Mentor teachers who accept more than one mentee will receive additional release time and compensation in accord with the job model designed by the Mentor Committee. The parties will coopetate on the use of Horace Mann grants to help support the expense of mentor teachers. \r\n2. Peer Assistance Program \r\nThe Professional Development Committee shall help to establish a voluntary Peer Assistance Program to be implemented by September, 1990. Teachers who request assistance would be eligible for help from a peer ot peers in improving their performance as a teacher. Release time and other professional development resources would be provided to support the peer(s)\' efforts within a sy~tem-wide budget of $40,000 per year or other amount approved by the Steering Committee. The Professional Development Committee shall engage in ongoing review of this program and provide a report on and additional recommendations for modifying and improving this program at least annually. \r\nThe peer assistance activity shall proceed parallel to and independent of the normal supervisory and evaluation process. Peers will not be permitted to testify (in person or through hearsay) in any disciplinary process, although the fact of an employee\'s participation or decision not to participate would not be excludable. \r\n14 \r\n\"\', \r\n! OTHER AGREEMENTS \r\nI --l \r\n1. Early Learninll Centers \r\nProvided that staff at early learning centers continue to arrange coverage during school vacations by staggering their work schedules, staff required to work in excess of ten months shall be paid on a pro rata basis for the additional time. \r\n2.

The Union agrees not to grieve these PO$tings. \r\nThe School Department agrees that if it is unable to reach the courtâ€¢mandated percentages of minority faculty by the 1990 deadline, it will not undertake involuntary excessing to meet the goals at that time. Instead, both parties agree to petition the court for an extension of time to achieve compliance. \r\nThe School Department will identify schools where minority representation among teachers is significantly less than the systemwide percentage for that particular level and will work in cooperation with the Union and the School Site Council (or principal/headmaster if there is no School Site Council) to increase that percentage. \r\nS.

The parties recognize that the most important interactions that aff~ct student performance Â·take place daily between teachers and students. Teachers, therefore, must. be given the. greatest voice indecisions about instructional matters .. The \r\nâ€¢ parties further agree that the building administrator is the key person responsible for creating\' the environment necessary to bring about positive change. Principals and headmasters, therefore, must lead all emp1oyee~ in schools by encouraging collaboration, shared decision making, and teamwork. \r\n\'The parties realize that in order to achieve I3hared deciSion making at the school level a significant restructuring of schools must occur; and the parties agree to work cooperatively in an effort to bring about these necessary changes. Significant changes in school organization, instructional practices, and staff roles will take time; they will not be accomplished in a single year; and the task will require a sustained commitment from the leadership of the Union and the School Committee, and the Superintendent of Schools. \r\nTo begin this effort, the parties agree to initiate six steps beginning in \r\nSeptember, 1989.

ALLEN \'SCHMIEDER \r\n\r\nOn October12, 1976 the New NationalTeacher Center Program was signed into law by the President. The last decade has seen an expoâ€¢nential expansion in the roles and responsibiliâ€¢ties of \"regular\" classroom teachers has also seen an almost equally irppressive increase in the number of new Federaland State programs directed at improving and reforming what happens in the Nation\'s classrooms. But the two have seldom been linked. Most programs intended to raise the quality ofschooling had to be implemented without the necessary staff development; most were \"outside-in\" programs-solutions developed somewhere outside the classroom and then expected to match the most urgent problems within the classroom. The New Teacher CenterLaw turns things \"insideout.\" Teachers will finally be given the major responsibility for determining the kinds of changes and improvements that are needed in their classrooms and will also have the lead in putting together the kinds of training and curriculum development proâ€¢grams that will best meet those needs. And center programs will draw heavily upon the experience and expertise of the teachers themâ€¢selves. In all of the passion during recent years to improve the knowledge base of education, most experts and policy makers have usually overlooked what is by far the most important part of that base-the classroom tested knowlâ€¢edge of teachers. At a recent meeting, the di-\r\nAllen Schmieder, Manager ofthe Teacher Celzter Program ill the Office of Educatioll has participated in numerous AFT conferences and seminars. In his administrative position in the Office of Education, he !ws implemented tlle Teacher Center program at the national level. Charles Lovett, Administrative Assistant in the Teaclzer Center Program, O.E., !laS participated in planning the delivery system that made federally funded Teacher Centers a reality in this decade. \r\nrector of a major educational development enâ€¢terprise understandably boasted that his high-powered staff included over 100 personâ€¢years ofexperience in educational reform. One could argue that the Nation\'s teachers constiâ€¢tute 20 million person-years of experience in educational reform. The teacher center proâ€¢vides one mechanism for further releasing the potential of this vast storehouse of educational successes. It is possible that the greatest adâ€¢vances in education in the near fuhue will be gained through developing more effective ways to link the creativity and experience of every classroom to every other classroom. \r\nThe basic purpose of the new Federal Teacher Centers Program is to enable teachers to have a greater voice in determining and meeting their own needs for inservice training .\' and curriculum development in relation to the needs of the students whom they serve. Teacher centers may serve a single school disâ€¢trict, a larger region, or an entire State. The chief feature of the centers is that each is superâ€¢vised by a \"teacher center policy board,\" of which the majority of members are elementary or secondary school classroom teachers. The program gives to State departments of educaâ€¢tion an important three-part role: screening applications, providing technical assistance, and assuring proper dissemination of the proâ€¢gram\'s findings and products. Ten percent the funds may be granted to institutions higher education to operate centers; the bal\" ance goes to local educational agencies. \r\nThe following briefly outline the characteristics of the Teacher Center Program. \r\n1. \r\nIt is the first major Federal program that requires that the teachers being served be centrally-involved in planning, developing, <1nd implementing projects. \r\n\r\n2. \r\nIt will increase the professional resource bilse by increasing the role of the teacher as\' innovator, researcher, developer, and trainer. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. \r\nIt is directed primarily at helping teachers with current classroom instructional problems. \r\n\r\n4. \r\nIt is directed mainly at the inservice eduâ€¢\r\n\r\n\r\ncation of all teachers-regardless of level or . subject. \r\nS. It is directed at all teachers in a project\'s service area. \r\n6. It is a relatively flexible and open program \r\napproach 	capable of responding quickly to immediate needs. \r\n7. Teacher cenâ€¢ter projects can serve both inâ€¢\r\ndividual .I1\\\'fL\'V~ needs and ~Q\"W\'rsystem needs. \r\n8. \r\nThe projâ€¢ects will be as site specific as possible -located as close to the classroom of participants as posâ€¢sible. \r\n\r\n9. \r\nBecause of reâ€¢leased time allowâ€¢ances, part of the programming can \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccur during the \"regular day.\" \r\n10. \r\nA high percentage of participation will be voluntary. \r\n\r\n11. \r\nIt can facilitate instructional improveâ€¢ment, necessitating the kind of attitudinal! behavioral changes which require long-range , training programs. \r\n\r\n12. \r\nIt is primarily an inservice education program, but can have significant links to preâ€¢service programs. \r\n\r\n13. \r\nIt marshalls the best possible reâ€¢sources-from a great variety of sources-to help teachers with immediate instructional problems. \r\n\r\n14. \r\nItpromotes an idea that could eventually serve all of the Nation\'s teachers. \r\n\r\n15. \r\nIt can accommodate considerable variety in grant size and program models. \r\n\r\n16. \r\nIt provides a potential delivery system ror-major staff development needs supported by other national and state authorizations; i.e., education for all handicapped children, conâ€¢sumers\' education, career education, metric education, energy education. \r\n\r\n17. \r\nIt supports a generic model of inservice education, not just courses or workshops. \r\n\r\n18. \r\nIt requires collaboration among teachers, teachers\' organizations, higher eduâ€¢cation, special education, vocational educaâ€¢tion, the school board, and the state education agency. \r\n\r\n19. \r\nIt provides substantial support for state involvement, especially in areas of technical assistance and dissemination. \r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Young, who served as Executive Diâ€¢rector of the President\'s Advisory Council on the Education Professions Development, sugâ€¢gested that one of the major weaknesses of most new Federal programs was that they rarely articulated the problems that they were being launched to overcome. Many program developers, he added, did not even consider whether they were dealing with any specifiC problems. He went on to recommend that at the beginning of any new legislative thrust, a succinct statement of the problems to be conâ€¢fronted should be developed and used as one of the major bases for later estimations of proâ€¢gram successes. As a context for the new Teacher Centers Program, we present a beginâ€¢ning list of some of the needs that gave rise to the legislation and to which it may be expected to relate. The list is presented to give added focus to what follows, and hopefully, to motiâ€¢vate readers sufficiently to help improve it. \r\n1. \r\nTraditional inservice education programs are generally not directly related to teachers\' most urgent needs, as teachers see them. \r\n\r\n2. \r\nInservice education, regardless ofquality, is generally provided in places that are far reâ€¢moved from where teachers teach, making it inconvenient and relatively unrelated to what is happening in schools. \r\n\r\n3. \r\nInservice education has generally been provided for teachers by \"experts\" other than teachers. Consequently, its purposes have generally not facilitated interaction between teachers and encouraged sharing of successful classroom experiences. \r\n\r\n4. \r\nSimilarly, most school curriculums are designed and developed by experts with little or no classroom experience, yet must be imâ€¢plemented by teachers. Some curriculum deâ€¢velopers go so far as to attempt to design \"teacher-proof\" curricula. \r\n\r\n5. \r\nThe training priorities of Federal proâ€¢grams are often unrelated to needs as teachers perceive them. \r\n\r\n6. \r\nTraditional inservice systems are not deâ€¢signed to respond systemwide and quickly to urgent local needs. . \r\n\r\n7. \r\nWith change and the knowledge base inâ€¢creasing at aD increasing rate,there is an urâ€¢gent need for all teachers to continually renew their knowledge and skills. \r\n\r\n8. \r\nUnemployed teachers need to be reâ€¢trained for new and neededroles in education. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. There is a need to prepare thousands of \r\neducational personnel in special education, counseling, early childhood, energy educaâ€¢tion, metric education, career education, etc. \r\nNo program, especially one supported with Federal funds, operates in isolation from the rest of the educational world. The trends and forces of the total national scene, and the way in which a particular program relates to them, often have more to do with its relative success and impact than whatever happens within specific projects. This larger context is espeâ€¢cially important with teacher centers because of their considerable potential for reforming inservice education-and because of the high interest of all of the major education conâ€¢stituencies in its programmatic growth and diâ€¢rection. Following is a summary of some of the national conditions and events that may have great relevance for the future of centeringâ€¢and vice versa. \r\n1. \r\nThe decline in school enrollment has reâ€¢sulted in wide-spread layoffs and reductions in force in a large number of school systems. Sigâ€¢nificant numbers of teachers have been forced to shift positions. In New York City, for examâ€¢ple, nearly 40 percent of the teachers of Engâ€¢lish, mathematics, and science have had to asâ€¢sume new and different assignments during the last several years. Considerable training will be needed to help these displaced teachers adjust to their new responsibilities. \r\n\r\n2. \r\nWith declining student enrollments and provisions in most master contracts for layoffs to be made on a seniority basis, the profesâ€¢sional work force will increasingly include more persons (1) with extended experience, (2) at the maximum salary, and (3) with higher levels of college or university preparation than before. Because formal academic preparation tends to be completed within the first six years of employment, this same trend will produce a work force whose most recent higher educaâ€¢tion experience will become more distant with each passing year. The percentage of teachers \r\n\r\n\r\nneeding more credits/courses for certification/ promotion/salary increases is sharply decreasâ€¢ing. In short, incentives for formal education are declining. In such cases, the only way that teachers can continue professional improveâ€¢ment will be through inservice education/ teacher centers. \r\n3. \r\nSchool needs and priorities are changing more and more rapidly each year. The classâ€¢room teacher of 1977, for example, is asked toÂ· be the major implementor of special educaâ€¢tion\'s mainstreaming, citizenship education, consumer education, community education, metric education, multi-cultural education, career education, energy education, etc., etc., etc. The 1960\' s provided considerable evidence that no new curriculum can be successfully introduced into the system without (1) accepâ€¢tance by teachers and (2) considerable staff deâ€¢velopment, developed mainly by the teachers to be involved. \r\n\r\n4. \r\nThe rapidly rising unemployment ofqualâ€¢Hied/certified teachers, estimated to exceed 500,000 in 1977, has important implications for teacher centers-especially in light President Carter\'s commitment to reduce unemployâ€¢ment. In New York City, for example, in 1975 only 3 percent of the eligible new teachers found jobs; 97 percent may have been added to the unemployment rolls. There are, however, severe shortages of teachers in a number of specialty areas; e.g., special education, counâ€¢seling and guidance, early childhood. The Teacher Center Program could give priority to retraining unemployed teachers in these and other shortage areas. Such a plan would not only reduce unemployment, but take less time, cost less, and develop broader-based specialists than programs that started from scratch with undergraduate students. \r\n\r\n5. \r\nWith declining student achievement scores over much of the Nation there have been increasing public demands that the schools \"return to the basics.\" School boards and other \r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders are reordering school priorities. The reversal of these declining scores may require the kind of large-scale inâ€¢service retraining program fostered by the NDEA and NSF institute programs developed in response to Sputnik. Teacher centers could provide such programs. \r\n6. \r\nCalifornia, New York and several other \"leader\" states are giving high emphasis to ensuring that all teachers are competent in the teaching of reading. Given the high imporâ€¢tance of the subject, it is likely that many other states will follow. Such a trend will require training and retraining for all teachers at all levels. The Right To Read program has done a commendable job (and could be closely coorâ€¢dinated with teacher center efforts) but is not generally directed at supporting inservice eduâ€¢cation in reading for all of the teachers in a ~ school system. The teacher center is ideally suited to carry out such a program. \r\n\r\n7. \r\nThere is increasing interest-in response to the rising cost of education and increased demands for educational accountability-in the more effective utilization of research findâ€¢ings regarding what works in the classroom. Relatively sophisticated national, state, and local diffusion and dissemination networks are being developed. The Office of Education and the National Institute of Education, and other agencies have growing catalogs of \"proven\" products and approaches. As with general curâ€¢riculum reform, the effective adoption and use \r\nof any validated educational product will reâ€¢quire staff development. Good product delivâ€¢ery systems will fail without adequate training \r\n\r\n\r\ncounterparts. \r\nThe Teacher Centers Program has captured the national interest. A great many educators are preparing to help develop and implement centers. Others are considering ways in which existing centers might be changed or producâ€¢tively linked with other teacher centers and resource bases. The high potential of the conâ€¢cept is clear. But from the beginning there will be a need to carefully think through what kinds of information will be needed by educational decision makers-in the field and in the government-in order to determine the proâ€¢gram\'s relative success. Too often methods of \"keeping track\" of what goes on are introâ€¢duced well after a program is underwayâ€¢when it is too late, or at least at a time when iUs difficult to build in the kind of data collection and assessment systems that will not only help policy makers but prove indispensable to proâ€¢gram managers. \r\nIn his landmark study of American Educaâ€¢tion Crisis in the Classroom, Silberman pointed up the fact that even where new educational approaches seemed to be succeeding, it was difficult to pin down why they were successful, because American educators did not usually have enough management information to be articulate about what, was going on in their programs. The Office of Education does not want to place too much emphasis on evaluaâ€¢tion of the Teacher Centers Program outcomes during the early going-the concept is new and it will take considerable time to work out many of the new processes that will be required in making programs fully operational. However, there is a need to begin to develop reasonable program expectations and then to begin the kind of data collection that will eventually help determine the extent to which those goals are being achieved. \r\nThe following list is offered to give center \r\ndevelopers and operators some guidance, \r\nwhether or not supported by Federal funds, \r\nregarding the kinds of outcomes they might \r\nwant to measure, and to stimulate as much \r\nthoughtful dialogue as possible about this most \r\nimportant subject. \r\n1. \r\neffectiveness as perceived by teachers \r\n\r\n2. \r\neffectiveness as perceived by adm.inisâ€¢trators \r\n\r\n3. \r\ndegree to which teachers\' individual \r\n\r\n\r\nneeds are met \r\n4. \r\ndegree to which the high priority training needs of school systems are met \r\n\r\n5. \r\nrelationship of training programs to subâ€¢stance of curriculum in classroom of particiâ€¢pants \r\n\r\n6. \r\nimpact on student achievement \r\n\r\n7. \r\nimpact on teaching skills \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. \r\nproximity of training programs to schools and communities of participant \r\n\r\n9. \r\nproportion of training during \"regular\" school hours \r\n\r\n10. \r\ndegree of teacher input into program development and implementation \r\n\r\n11. \r\nextent of teacher-developed curricula used in training programs \r\n\r\n12. \r\nextent to which programs are more comprehensive and systematic than traditional inservice programs \r\n\r\n13. \r\namount of teacher interaction and sharâ€¢ing of classroom successes \r\n\r\n14. \r\nincrease in utilization of new learning concepts, approaches, and research findings \r\n\r\n15. \r\ndegree to which teachers are better preâ€¢pared in high priority staff development needs areas; e.g., mainstreaming, basic skills, readâ€¢ing, energy education \r\n\r\n16. \r\nimpact in terms of the above on other forms of inservice education. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper has roughly outlined the nature of the New Teacher Centers Program from the view point of the program managers in the Office of Education. It must be emphasized that this analysis and characterization is a tenâ€¢tative one which is sure to change, in some cases substantially. As the program evolves, important lessons will be learned, and necesâ€¢sary adjustments will be made. The most imâ€¢portant input and feedback will be that which comes from the major constituents of the teacher celiter-the teachers and their organiâ€¢zations who promoted and helped develop the legislation and who will have much to do with shaping its future. \r\n\r\n\r\nTeacher Corps I \r\nand I \r\n1eacher Centers: \r\n\r\nForging New .Alliances \r\nBy DR.

CHRISTINE SAN JOSE \r\n\r\nOutline: \r\n1. \r\nRecognition that many of us hope for no less than reform \r\n\r\n2. \r\nTwo contexts of teaching, hence of teacher education reform, to be taken into account-schools are organizations, schooling within society \r\n\r\n3. \r\nRole of Teacher Centers in above conâ€¢texts, promoting both organizational health and links with school community-hence nurâ€¢turing the circumstances and the climate necessary for effecting Teacher Education Reâ€¢form \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Recognition of the Enormity of the Challenge \r\nThe speaker welcomes the invitation proffered by the title of this session to discuss Teacher Education Reform, since she believes thus strong a word appropriate in describing what many of us are currently hoping for. And once we acknowledge the size of what we\'re after, we are less likely to neglect consideration of the many complexities that attend any attempt at change in the schools. There are current writâ€¢ers on inservice education and the possible role of teacher centers (noticeable theoreticians rather than those primarily in the field) who apparently assume that\' improvement of inâ€¢struction in schools is largely a matter of imâ€¢provement of the education of teachers which in turn is largely a matter of delivering the appropriate training at the appropriate time and place. The present speaker holds that we have a less than useful view if we fail to take \r\nDr. Christine San Jose was the director of the West Genesee/Syracuse University Teaching Center in Syracuse, NY, and has been a tireless supporter of the teacher-directed preservice and inservice proâ€¢gram. She has broad experience in planning with teachers and assessing their professiollailleeds. The Teaching Center under her direction sen)ed both elementary and secondary school teachers. \r\ninto account the context of teaching and hence of any attempts at reform. \r\n2. The Environment of Teaching: Two Highly Influential Contexts \r\n2.1 Schools as Organizatiol1s --After a brief look at the realities of teaching, noting the powerful influence of the environment in which it takes place, the speaker concludes that it is schools which are in the business of teaching (the teachers as vital elements within them), and that we must examine the schools and school districts for those characteristics which are likely to help or hinder reform. \r\nAided by studies of organization behavior, we recognize that an organization\'s ability to achieve its goals, to adapt, to \"reform\", is intiâ€¢mately linked to what has been called its orâ€¢ganization effectiveness, or organizational health. Matthew Miles has specified ten comâ€¢ponents of organizational health, as given beâ€¢low. The speaker suggests that when we weigh the possible forces for and against reform in general in the schools, these components offer useful indices; and further suggests that we use these, or similar, indices to weigh the forces for and against reform within our own particular schools or districts, i. e. the strengths that we can build on and the weaknesses and dangers that we must recognize and address. The ten components will therefore be gone through twice: the first time through we shall very briefly relate each one to what we know of schools in general; and the second time through, listeners who have embarked on, or are about to embark on, \"reform\" in their own schools or districts or combinations of these, are invited to give a few moments of thought to how their own organizations stack up in these \r\nten areas. Here, then, are Miles\' components or orâ€¢ganizational health: \r\n1. \r\nGoal focus \r\n\r\n2. \r\nCommunication adequacy \r\n\r\n\r\n3. \r\nOptimal power equalization \r\n\r\n4. \r\nResources utilization \r\n\r\n5. \r\nCohesiveness \r\n\r\n6. \r\nV10rale \r\n\r\n7. \r\nInnovativeness \r\n\r\n8. \r\nAutonomy \r\n\r\n9. \r\nAdaptation \r\n\r\n10. \r\nProble:n-Solving adequacy \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(relation of these to the school context will clarift/ what is \'lli!al1 t hlJ these sometimes el1 ig\'llatic labels) \r\nThe speaker reiterates that it is inviting frusâ€¢tration and disillusion to work for refor.n withâ€¢out taking these issues into account. \r\n2.2 Schooling within Socieh/-Here we consider the i:11plications for the teacher\'s task fro,n soâ€¢ciety\'s expectation that education function as an institution for societal ;naintenance. Brieflv (alas) we touch on the crux of the dile:n:na: a charge to develop the potential of a creature so highly individuated as a human being, yet at one and the same time a charge to work for the smooth-running and continuance of society. Further, we note the :11Ultiplication of upâ€¢heaval and uncertainty and apparent conflict of aims when so many deep-rooted values of a society are being questioned as they are today. \r\nWe therefore recognize that delivering to the teacher, and supporting him or her, with the soundest, most effective pedagogical knowlâ€¢edge and strategies is of little use if the resulâ€¢tant teachingis inconflict with the expectations of the community. \r\n3. Role of Teacher Centers Reviewing what appear to be the dominant \r\n. characteristics of what we might recognize as existing \"Teacher Centers\", i.e. reviewing not the various \"typologies\" that distinguish one fro:n another but struggling to perceive rather the basic concerns and approaches which they have in common, we come up with a cluster \r\n12 \r\n~ \r\n~ c \r\nw @ M\r\n\r\n\r\n\'8 \r\nremarkably consonant with \r\nwhat \r\nhave been distinguished ments crucial to organizational health. A rapid run-through of Miles\' list (as above) \r\n\r\nmakes this abundantly clear.. Further, we note the sensitivity of center after center to their wider communities, frequentlyÂ·Â· welcoming and working in their many difâ€¢ferent ways not only with parents but with other community groups also, to some offering: services and to others (business, for example) providing opportunities for them to help their district teachers an<;i children. In short, this speaker sees centers as subsuming, not subâ€¢sumed by, teacher education. The centers that we see going strong, and bidding fair within !. their operation to effect Teacher Education Reâ€¢form, are those which recognize the power and complexities of the contexts within which they have their being. Bringing together the many different people in many different roles who are involved in teaching, working with them towards healthy organizational and commuâ€¢nity understanding and partnership, they are then able to tackle with some success the more. specific task (among their many others) of enâ€¢hancement of actual teaching behavior. \r\nI hope with all.ny head and heart (which frequently find it difficult and probably productive, to separate) that teachers will deed find a new and powerful voice in T Centers; and that with it they willbring about a shining cluster of reform. It is because I care so :nuch that I urge all of those concerned to head on the complexities involved, and to the;n with the wisdom and the courage that for one have never found it so very hard to in our profession. We\'re going to need them! \r\nThe Detroit Center for Professional \r\n\r\nGrowth and \r\nDevelopment \r\nBy THERESA LORIO \r\n\r\nWHAT WE ARE \r\nThe Center for Professional Growth and Deâ€¢velopment, operating since 1976, is the first state-supported professional development center in \\1ichigan. Its establishment repreâ€¢sented a \"break-through\"-a major commitâ€¢ment by the Office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Board ofEducaâ€¢tion, and the State Legislature to support the plan of key educational leaders in the Detroit community for pioneering new directions for the inservice education of school personnel. \r\nThe Detroit Center for Professional Growth and Development represents the Detroit plan for a model inservice project. It is based on the assumption that the behavior ofeducation perâ€¢sonnel is a :najor influenceable variable which affects the learning process. \r\nThe Detroit Center has a nu.nber of unique features which have attracted over6,OOO volunâ€¢tary participants since \\1arch, 1976. Among these key features are: \r\n1. \r\nFlexibility: The ability to respond to a wide variety ofrequests with appropriate trainâ€¢ing models and consultants whether from a \"high-need\" school or a school where students may be performing well in reading and compuâ€¢tational skills \r\n\r\n2. \r\nDirect involvement of participants in identifying their inservice needs and designing the training activities, which leads to personal commitments for effective change. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Detroit Center has two outreach comâ€¢ponents and a support system for the delivery of services: \r\nTheresa Lorio, Assistant Director of the Detroit Center for Professional Growth and Development has represented the AFT at state and national conâ€¢ferences. She has. teaching experience in urban schools as teacher, master teacher, and educational consultant and inservice specialist. Her urban expeâ€¢rience provides. her with insight into the preservice and inservice needs of teachers. \r\nField COllsllltant Serl.\'ices is the principal outâ€¢reach coniponent through which service is available to all segments of the educational community-region, school, city-wide, or inâ€¢\r\ndividual staff me:11ber. Regardless of the chil-__ \r\ndren they serve-low achievers, high achievâ€¢ers, handicapped, gifted-staffs may request and receive training and support. After a need. has been specified by an assessment process, FieLi Services provide consultants and reâ€¢sources to enable the requesting staff to engage in productive inservice experiences. When a need is pervasive, training is :11ade available on \r\na region or syste.n-wide basis. \r\nKey features of Field Consultant Services are flexibility, accessibility, promptness of reâ€¢sponse, and the :najor role of requesters in designing the training experience. Special Project Schools is the component fro.n which ;nost specific research data are collected to:neasure the impact of staff training on pupil achievement. \r\nEighty percent of the personnel in Special Project Schools must agree to participate with the Center in a three-year sequential inservice process that is designed to raise pupil achievement in reading and mathematics and to positively influence school climate. The process is linked directly to the needs and exâ€¢pectations of students and educators. \r\n\r\nSEQUE:\"J\'TIAL INSERVICE PROCESS \r\nI-Develop Awareness of Inservice Process \r\n2-Demonstrate Commitment to Inservice \r\n\r\nProcess \r\n3-Identify Expectations of Students and \r\n\r\nStaff \r\n4-Assess and Prioritize \r\n\r\n5-Plan Inservice Activities based on High Priority \\reeds, Achievement Plans, etc. \r\n6-Identify Resources to be committed to inâ€¢\r\n\r\nservice activities \r\n7-Implement and Evaluate Inservice Acâ€¢\r\n\r\ntivities \r\n8-\\1onitor student achievement and school climate. \r\n-A Detroit Center Inservice Specialist is asâ€¢signed to work with the staff on a systematic basis \r\n-Support services are available from all components of The Detroit Center \r\n-Staff of The Detroit Center assist in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the inservice process \r\n-The Detroit Center, with the cooperation of other agencies when appropriate, provides consultants for the inservice process \r\n-An Inservice Leadership Team composed of school staff and the Inservice Specialist coordinates and monitors the training process. \r\nSupport System: VIathematics and Reading Reâ€¢source Centers are two curriculum centers that support Field Consultant Services and the Special Project Schools. Support is in the form of equipment, modules, and materials for teaching/learning reading and mathematics, and curriculum inservice consultants who are specialists in their field. \r\nAs support to Field Consultant Services, the Reâ€¢source Centers: \r\n-Respond to requests of Field Consultant Services for providing inservice activities in reading and in mathematics education \r\n-Conduct needs assessment surveys to deâ€¢termine school, region, or city-wide needs reâ€¢lated to the teaching of reading and of mathematics \r\n-Sponsor workshop series, conferences, exhibits, and seminars related to \"highâ€¢needs.\" \r\nAs support to the Special Project Schools, the Resource Centers: -<;ooperate with members of the schools\' \r\nInservice Leadership Teams in planning the three-year training -Help staff identify inservice needs related to reading and mathematics \r\n-Resp\':\'111d to requests of Special Project Schools for inservice activities in reading and mathematics. \r\nWHAT HAVE WE DONE As a center that relies exclusively on voluntary staff participation and has no funds to pay stipends, the Detroit center has from October, 1976 through August, 1977: \r\nâ€¢ \r\nSponsored 393 inservice series \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nWith 1,153 separate sessions \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nRepresenting a cumulative attendance of 21,711 \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nLasting a total of 57,439.5 hours \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nDeveloped follow-up procedures, to faciliâ€¢tate in-the-classroom use of Center-learned skills \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nInitiated a replicable process/model for in-depth local school staff development \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nPiloted pre and posttesting ofparticipants, to ascertain the effectiveness of Center inserâ€¢vice activities in imparting new information \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nInvestigated ways to measure the impact of staff inservice on pupil performance \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nDeveloped a variety of training modules \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nImplemented linkages with the Detroit Public Schools for cooperative planning, sharâ€¢ing of staff expertise, and funding support for selected projects of the Professional Developâ€¢ment Office, Title One, ESAA, and Chapter 3 programs \r\n\r\nâ€¢ \r\nServed as the catalyst for establishing inter-institutionally-sponsored credit courses that involved 8 participating schools or colleges of education in southeastern Michigan, as a spinoff of Center inservice activities. \r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IMPACT WE HAVE HAD \r\nâ€¢ Detroit staffs, in large numbers and deâ€¢spite system-wide mandatory inservice proâ€¢\r\ngrams, voluntarily seek Center training \r\nâ€¢ \r\nRequests for services from The Field \r\nsultant Services Component and the Rea \r\nResource Center EXCEED the Center\'s \r\nsonnel and fiscal resources.

The report of the President\'s National Commission on Excellence in Education, \"A Nation at-Risk\", set the tone for the long overdue upgrading of our nation\'s schools. \r\nUnfortunately, the single issue of merit pay for teachers has dominated the educational agenda with insufficient attention given to other more significant concerns of attracting and keeping the best teachers, providing a positive learning environment and encouragâ€¢ing all students to attain their fullest potential. \r\n\"Merit Pay\" is a ;.simplistic.appr.oach t.hat in and :\'0Â£ itself does little or nothing to improve our schools. It is obvious, however, that the public, as well as the Legislature, is convinced that additional pay for meritorious work is a threshold issue in the development of any e.ducation reform package. \r\nThe most recent attempts by the legislatively-established Florida Quality Instruction Incentives Council, where a majority of nonâ€¢educators are about to make educational decisions that will impact on yOlll1g people for generations to come, leave us no choice but to develop a comprehensive educational plan, not from an \"ivory tower\" or corporate board room perspective, but from the classrooms and those who must daily face the challenges of educating our citizens of tomorrow. \r\nThis comprehensive plan, Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative in Teaching, provides the blueprint for making our educational system the finest in the nation. \r\nOver the years, teachers have been saddled with one innovation after another, only to find that they usually were lll1derfunded, not funded \r\nat all, or replaced by newer programs before determining if the older ones were successful. \r\nFEA/United\'s comprehensive plan, Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative in Teaching, seeks to meet three overall objectives: \r\n1. 	\r\nAccomplish the State Board education goal to reach the upper quartile by 1985 in salaries and educational achievement. \r\n\r\n2. 	\r\nIdentify and sustain exemplary school programs. \r\n\r\n3. 	\r\nAttract and retain the best teachers. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific programs and costs are outlined below. We urge the Florida Legislature to enact the plan at its 1984 session. Although not all the provisions may be implemented by 1984, we believe that complete implementation can be achieved within 3 years, and Florida would be .... well on its way to becoming the Number 1 educational state in the nation. \r\nWe caution, however, that our support is contingent upon first the achievement of the upper quartile salary goal, and second, funding of a comprehensive program designed to meet the real needs of \r\neducation. \r\nIt should be noted that the special bi-partisan panel named by Congress to consider merit pay for teachers recently concluded that without substantial increases in basic pay for teachers, rewardâ€¢ing only a few with merit pay \"will have little impact.\" \r\nGOAL #1 -ACCOMPLISH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION OBJECTTVE\" TO REACH THE UPPER QUARTILE BY 1985 IN SALARIES\' AND EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT. \r\nWith great fanfare during February, 1980, the S\'tate Board of Educaâ€¢tion first adopted the following as a goal for the 1981-83 budget: \r\n\"In order to maintain and recruit quality teachers in \r\nour public schools in Florida, teachers\' salaries on \r\na statewide basis shall rank in the upper 25th percenâ€¢\r\ntile or among the top 12 states in the nation.\" \r\nIn 1981, the State Board of Education extended the salary goal so that the upper quartile would be reached by 1985. and it also set policy on student performance, when it said: \r\n\"On a statewide average, educational achievement in \r\nthe State of Florida will equal that of the upper \r\nquartile of states within five years, as indicated \r\nby commonly accepted criteria of attainments.\" \r\nSince the adoption of the upper quartile goals, student achieveâ€¢ment, based upon a variety of indicators, has been steadily rising. \r\nDuring the same time, salaries, unfortunately, have not enjoyedthe same gain made by student achievement; In fact, Florida has actually lost ground in comparison to other states in average \r\nteacher salaries. \r\nThe latest breakdown of Florida\'s 476 National Merit Scholarship students shows that only five are considering teaching as a career. The overwhelming reason given by the state\'s top students for byâ€¢passing teaching as a profession was long hours and low pay. \r\nConsequently, the first order of business must be to fund the money necessary to reach the upper quartile salary goal by 1985, as set by the State Board of Education. \r\nSalaries of Florida teachers are $3,400 below the average teacher \r\nsalary of the 12th ranked state. $306 million, plus an additional \r\n$55 million in social security and retirement matching, will be needed for the state\'s 90,000 teachers to reach the upper quartile \r\nsalary level. \r\n2 \r\n\r\nGOAL 4f:2 -IDENTIFY AND SUSTAIN EXEMPLARY SCHOOL PROGRAMS \r\nIn order to recognize outstanding school programs, it is necessaryfor the state to provide funds to the school districts for: \r\n(a) 	\r\nrecognizing schools which develop and implement programs that promote academic excellence and improved student performance;and \r\n\r\n(b) 	\r\nrewarding school employees who participate in and contribute to such programs; and \r\n\r\n(c) 	\r\nexpanding programs that have already been identified as exemâ€¢plary school activities. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following programs should be funded to implement the goaland objective\" outlined above: \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nExpansion of PREP to K-6 $60 million \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nEnhance Math/Science/Computer Skills $20 million \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nIncrease the number of teacher aides $40 million \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nInitiate pilot programs to improvealternative education $20 million \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nNew exemplary pro~rams to encourage\r\n\r\nschool level exce 1ence \" 	$35 million \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nProvide salary increases to the classiâ€¢fied school personnel, plus social securityand retirement matching $118 million \r\n\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that upgrading the physical plant, air conditioningand other similar features are necessary to establish a positivelearning environment, however, they must be dealt with separately. \r\nGOAL #3 -ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE BEST TEACHERS \r\nFEA/United recommends the establishment of the Career Teacher Program to provide for professional growth and development. \r\nThe Career Teacher Program contains four levels of teaching classiâ€¢fication: Apprentice Teacher, Senior Teacher, Associate Master Teacher and Master Teacher. \r\nMovement on the Career Ladder from one level to another is dependent upon successful performance in the current level, additional trainâ€¢ing as part of a planned program and favorable recommendations by a team of evaluators. \r\n\" \r\n3 \r\n\r\n\". \r\nTeachers currently teaching will be designated \"Teacher\" and will be paid on the regular salary schedule. In order to advance alongthe Career Ladder, to Senior Teacher, Associate M~ster Teacher and \r\n) \r\nMaster Teacher levels, all the regular requirements must be met. \r\nA cooperative management-union training program will be developed and implemented to ensure that administrators are trained to evaluate personnel, consistently, fairly and objectively, \r\nUnder the Career Teacher Program, employees will continue to be paid under salary schedules negotiated in collective bargaining contracts. Additional compensation for movement on the Career \r\nLadder would be funded by the state to school districts. \r\nAn integral part of the Career Teacher Program will be the expansion \r\nof the Beginning Teacher Program to include a one-year internship. \r\nThis will be followed by a period of two-to-four additional years of \r\nsupervision and assistance. At the end of the 5th year, teachers \r\nwill be required to meet the qualifications of Senior Teacher, or they will not be permitted to continue teaching. \r\nThose who meet the higher standards of Senior Teacher will be rewarded with $5,000 on top of their regular pay on the salary schedule. \r\nOne of the requirements of achieving Senior Teacher status will be a Master\'s degree in field. With the establishment of this requireâ€¢\r\nment, the \"Master\'s In field\" will have to be revamped in most universities to make the degree relevant. Teachers will be reimâ€¢bursed tuition as an additional incentive to continue training in their field of teaching. \r\nTeachers who already have Master\'s Degrees, but not in field, can meet the qualification by successfully completing 15 semester hours of in field courses. \r\nLEVEL I -APPRENTICE TEACHER \r\nQualifications: (1) Have achieved minimum of Bachelors Degree in an accredited school of higher learning; and (2) Successfully completed the Beginning Teacher Test. \r\nCompensation: Apprentice Teachers will be paid on the regularteachers\' salary schedule commensurate with educational attainment and prior experience. \r\nDuties: The Beginning Teacher Program will be expanded to broaden experiences so that new teachers will be given maximum opportunity to develop to their fullest potential. Time will be allocated for observation of other teachers and ass.istance will be provided by Associate Master and Master Teachers. \r\n) \r\n4 \r\n\r\nThe first year will be a full year of internship where the Apprenâ€¢\r\ntice Teacher teaches no more than 50% of the time. The remaining years of apprentice teaching will include supervision and assisâ€¢\r\ntance. \r\nBy the end of the fifth year, an Apprentice Teacher must meet the qualifications of a Senior Teacher, or will no longer be perâ€¢mitted to teach. Normally, Apprentice Teachers will advance to Senior Teacher after the 5th year, but may apply after the 3rd year. \r\nThis \"Up or Out\" provision is a maj or feature of the Career Teachingâ€¢Program. Those teachers who meet the rigorous standards of becoming a Senior Teacher will be recognized as outstanding teachers. \r\nLEVEL II -SENIOR TEACHER \r\nQualifications: (1) Successful completion of at least 3 years as an Apprentice Teacher and been favorably recommended by a panel of evaluators; and (2) Received a Master\'s Degree in the field which \r\nthe teacher teaches. \r\nCompensation: As compensation for meeting the high standards of the Level, an amount of $5,000, in addition to their regular salary, will be awarded to Senior Teachers. \r\nDuties: Teachers achieving the classification of Senior Teacher will be recognized as outstanding teachers. Senior Teachers will be employed on a ten-month contract and will be assigned classroom responsibilities 100% of the time. \r\nLEVEL III -ASSOCIATE MASTER TEACHER \r\nQualifications: (1) Successful completion of at least 3 years as \r\na Senior Teacher; (2) Completion of additional training as part of \r\na planned program and be tested on the training; and (3) Favorably \r\nrecommended by a panel of evaluators. \r\nc0:tensation: Associate Master Teachers will be compensated with \r\n$5, 00 above the Senior Teacher level in addition to the regular \r\nsalary schedule and also. receive an extra 10% of regular salary \r\nfor the 11th month of employment. \r\nDuties: Associate Master Teachers will continue to devote most \r\nof their time (from 75%-100%) to classroom teaching, but will be \r\nutilized in the development of curriculum and other instructional \r\nleadership responsibilities. \r\n5 \r\nLEVEL IV -MASTER TEACHER \r\n\r\nQualifications: (1) Successful completion of at least 2 years \'as an Associate Master Teacher; (2) Completed additional training as part of a planned program and be tested on the training; and (3)Favorably recommended bya panel of evaluators. \r\nCompensation: Master Teachers will receive $5,000 above the Associate Master level in addition to the regular salary schedule. The Master Teacher will also be compensated 20% above the regularsalary for l2-month employment. \r\nDuties: The Master Teacher will be the highest level of attainâ€¢ment in terms of salary and distinction in the Career Teacher Program. The Master Teacher will spend up to one-half their time in various instructional leadership roles such as supervising new teachers, developing curriculum, reviewing textbooks and ether teaching materials, etc. This will still permit the Master Teacher to teach in the classroom at least 50% of the time. \r\nCOSTS FOR THE CAREER TEACHING PROGRAM \r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nTraining for Principals to Evaluate Personnel -A joint programin cooperation with the union. $10 million \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nTuition Reimbursement -To encourage teachers to get Master\'s Degrees in field and thus get up-to-date training. in their teachâ€¢ing areas. \' $4 million \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nOutstanding Student Scholarship Plan -Payment of full cost of college education for outstanding students to enter teaching.Costs will be repaid on a one-for-one basis with years of teachâ€¢ing in the public schools. $30 million \r\n\r\nâ€¢ 	\r\nRetirement Incentives -To encourage early retirement to make way for newer teachers.

Anything less will be simply a piecemeal approach and will be doomed to failure. \r\nThe National Connnission on Excellence in Education concluded that, \"If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war...We have, in effect, been committing an act of unthinkable, unilateral educational disarmaâ€¢ment.\" \r\nIn light of that statement, FEA/United\'s Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative in Teaching should be viewed as a battle plan to regain our past commitment to education and win the war over ignorance. \r\nThe Career Teaching Program, coupled with achieving the upper quartile goals and development of the Outstanding Student Scholarâ€¢ship Plan, will have provided the vehicle for turning around the 30-year drift away from at.tracting the \"brightest and the best\" into the ranks of teaching. It will provide the incentive for talented young people to receive a college education with the end result of getting the best minds into the classroom. \r\nAs this overall plan is developed more fully, it will be necessary to deal with many related issues such as certification requirements. We urge that a complete rev.iew of the teacher certification law, in light of this proposal, be undertaken prior to legislative sunset in 1985. \r\nProvisions must also be made to re-examine the traditional roles \r\nof administrative and quasi-administrative positions, where some responsibilities for instructional leadership may now shift to \r\nfunctions of teachers in the Career Teaching Program. \r\nFEA/United prides itself for having been on the cutting edge of \r\nchange throughout its 97-year history. Mandating Excellence \r\nand Rewarding Initiative in .Teaching puts us once again at the \r\nforefront of change. \r\nWe believe that it will provide for professional growth, recognize \r\nand reward outstanding performance and inspire excellence in our \r\nclassrooms. \r\n* * * \r\n9 \r\n'),(4956,98,2,50,0,'Mandating Excellence and Rewarding Initiative in Teaching'),(7004,97,2,1,0,'November 	21, 1988 \r\nM E M 0 RAN DUM \r\nTO: 	Al Shanker Bella Rosenberg Marilyn Rauth Bruce Goldberg , -.. :-; I\'\" ...... \'\" \r\n\r\n.. \'J \r\nFROM: 	Marsha Levin~ \r\nRE: 	Ray Budde, Part II \r\nThis is a scheme for redesigning school districts according to a new model of organization including the following components: \r\n-Decision making \r\n-Calendar \r\n-Compensation \r\n-Career patterns \r\n-Mission of schooling \r\n-Curriculum and materials. \r\n\r\nAt the core is the notion of Charter Schools (page 4).

One means for reforming American public education is to change how local school districts are organized and how they function. Miller\'s categories of subsystems and Kuhn\'s c~cept of the interdependent qualities or states of subsystems are helpful in determining just what \"system\" is. Implementing a redesign of six key components of the organâ€¢ization of local education would be sufficient to change t~e basic character and direction of a school district. The obâ€¢stacles to making these kinds of substantial changes in organâ€¢ization would be formidable as the power structure of the local school district would be radically altered. Changes of this magnitude need to be made within the context of a five to tenâ€¢year period of planning and development. \r\nMost of the committees and task groups which studied the condition of the \r\npublic schools in the early and mid-1980\'s concluded that there were serious \r\nflaws in the way we in America are educating our children and youth. That \r\nthis should be a matter of serious concern to the citizens of this country \r\nis strongly implied in the title of the first study which was commissioned by \r\nPresident Reagan shortly after he took office: A Nation at Risk: the Imperative \r\nfor EducatiOnal\'Reform. l If the very nation is at risk -and, presumably, \r\neducators bear some of the blame -we in education had better do something \r\nabout it! But what? \r\nThe remedy in the past when we were confronted with reports of serious \r\nweaknesses in public education was \"to improve the parts\": \r\n... \"Raise teachers\' salaries so that more of the ablest and talented young people will enter teaching.\" \r\n... \"Beef up teacher education. Put more substance and reality into how we train teachers.\" \r\n-\"Raise standards. Do more testing of competency in basic skills. Strengthen graduation requirements.\" \r\n.\'. \r\n\r\n-\"Tighten up the discipline. Make schools orderly so that pupils can learn.\" \r\n-\"Improve the textbooks and other instructional materials. Install computers in every classroom (or at every desk).\" \r\n-IJStrengthe.n preparation and inservice programs for principals , ,and superintendents so that the schools are better managed.\" \r\nBut this is the approach we have used for decades -and schools have changed very little. An alternative \"to improving the parts\" is to make subâ€¢stantial changes in how schools and school districts and the education-serving agencies are organized and how they function. This entails as an initial step a major effort in redesigning educational organizations. \r\n\'Focusing on the school district \r\nMost of the effort resulting from the studies advocating educational reâ€¢\r\nform have focused on various models for redesigning the individual school. It \r\nis my positon that unless the total school district (which includes the school \r\nboard, the superintendent, the central office staff, specialists, department \r\nheads. and teachers) is restructured the changes at the school level will \r\nsoon be compromised and weakened. \r\nIf we\'re going to redesign the school district, where do we go to find \r\n\"it\" -the structural timbers -the framework within which \"education happens\" \r\nfrom day to day? \r\nJames Miller provides us with a total, almost universal, umbrella for \r\nidentifying the subsystems which make up any \"living system.\" Clearly, a school \r\ndistrict is an organization in his \"shred-out\" of all the levels of living \r\nsystems.2 Dr. Miller lists 18 separate subsystems that are components of his \r\nexample of ano,rganization. a modern ocean liner. 3 The local school district \r\nmight well have fewer subsystems in that it is predominantly an information \r\nsystem rather than a matter-energy system. \r\nAlfred Kuhn has contributed much to my thinking about just what the rockâ€¢\r\nbottom meaning of ,the concept of system (or organization in operation). The \r\nsystem is not the collection of entities or subsystems in the system, but \r\nrather the interdependence and the interlocking of a specific set of chosen \r\nproperties (or qualities or states) of those entities or subsystems -this \r\nis what makes up the system. \r\nThe elements.: or components of a system are not the entities in the system, but qualities or states of those-;;tities. In the thermostatic \'system, it is not the air in the room, but its temâ€¢perature which L~ the element in the system. It is not the thermoâ€¢stat, but the position of its switch. It is not the furnace, but its state of being on or off. Similarly, the environment is not the outside air, but the temperature of the outside air along with the properties of the wall which will determine how fast heat will move between system and environment.\" \r\nThus changing the system of the school district involves moving from the present set of qualities or states of the subsystems to a new set of desired or chosen qualities or states of the subsystems of the school district. It is not necessary to change the state of every subsystem. Changing the states of a number of the more important subsystems will force changes in many of the states of other subsystems -as it is the states, the qualities of the subsystems which are interdependent and interlocked. \r\nRedesigning six organizational components of the school district \r\nNow let\'s do a bit of a redesigning; some \"organizational imaging\" will\' \r\ngive us some idea of what the school district of the next century might look \r\nlike. Without regard for \"how we get there from here,\" let\'s redesign six \r\ncomponents or SUbcomponents of the organization of the school district: \r\nDecision making related to the control of the function of instruction. \r\nHow the year is used/divided for the purposes of schooling. \r\nCompensation plan for certified professional staff. \r\n\r\nCareer patterns for teachers, specialists, and administrators. \r\nA major mission of the school. \r\nInstructional materials and sources of information for teaching. \r\n\r\nSketch 1.

I would agree that Â·this is an awkward fit. \r\nLocus of decision making (Sketch 1) clearly fits as part of \r\nthe subsystem of \"Decider(de).\" \r\nThe length and structure of the school year (Sketch 2) and \r\nthe mission of the school (Sketch 5) could be viewed as \r\nconceptua~ \"Boundaries(BO)\" of time and objective. \r\n\r\nThe compensation plan (Sketch 3) is an important dimension \r\nof how the \"captain and crew\" of the school district are \r\nsustained and motivated. \r\n\r\nCareer plans (Sketch 4) are patterns of position-holding by \r\n\r\npersonnel of the school district over 40-year periods of time. \r\nInstructional materials and sources of information for teachâ€¢\r\ning (Sketch 6) are obviously \"inputs\" which move through sevâ€¢\r\neral of the subsystems. \r\n\r\nThe match might have been more exact had the example for the level of organization been an information system such as a college, an adult learning center, or a research corporation. \r\nThe interdependence or the \"interlockedness\" of the new states of these six entities (Kuhn) is much more obvious. We need to start with the premise that the main reason the school district exists is to carry out the function of instruction. \r\nGiving teachers responsible control over instruction makes teaching the premier professional position in the school district. \r\nThis fact is recognized by giving teachers a full-time job and paying them as the same rate and level as specialists and administrators. \r\nWith teachers on the same work year and compensation plan as other professionals, they can then build diversified careers (according to their interests and qualifications) by having the option of moving out of and back to the classâ€¢room to and from specialist and administrative positions. \r\nGiving teachers significant amounts of time for planning and \r\nto \r\n\r\ncurriculum development linke\'d with the decentralized capaâ€¢\r\nbilities brought on by technology in the graphic arts and copy machine industries now makes it possible for teachers \r\nto write their own textbooks and create their own learning materials for the classroom. Access to ever-expanding data banks of information adds a very exciting dimension to proâ€¢\r\nviding materials for learning. \r\nThere is a flip side to teachers having responsible control over instruction. Teachers being in charge of the function for which they are trained and publicly certified would make it incumbent on them to assume as their number one responsiâ€¢\r\nbility that of helping pupils take charge of their own learnâ€¢ing. This is especially important during a time which is \r\nnow designated as the \"Age of Information.\" Developing the \r\nattitudes and skills to become lifelong learners is crucial for today\'s pupils if they are to prosper and survive as adults. \r\nNeed for a long-term view \r\nChanging these six entities in the organization of local education would \r\nundoubtedly result in an observably different kind of school district. But \r\nthere is no quick fix here. Redesigning a school district and implementing \r\nthe new model of organization is not going to happen within the confines of \r\na single school year -or even two or three school years. \r\nThe fictitious superintendent in Education by Charter, \"Dr. William \r\nWright,\" presents the community with a ten-year plan for totally reorganizing \r\nthe \"Hometown Public Schools.,,5 This kind of span of time allows for a number \r\nof things to happen. \r\nA multi-year, computer-based program budget format can be \r\ndeveloped, tested, and adopted. \r\nGroups of teachers can develop plans for educational charters and then, if the charters are granted, can field test teachâ€¢ing under the charters for three. four. or five years. \r\nAs needs develop and anxieties rise. appropriate inservice and staff development activities can be planned and carried out. \r\nGenuine roles can be developed for parents and other citizens \r\non charter planning committees and charter advisory committees. \r\nPrincipals have sufficient time to tryout new roles as supporters \r\n,, \r\n\r\nof instruction rather than administrators over instruction. The flexibility of educational charters would encourage a principal to be part of a teaching staff of a charter in his! her field of expertise. \r\nThe school district could develop within the schools or the community the capability of producing its own texts and inâ€¢structional materÂ·ials. Arrangements could be made to access the many regional and national data banks which could provide information which would enrich classroom instruction. \r\nA network of outside persons from universities, other school districts, and other institutions could be formed to monitor and evaluate the impact of organizational changes over a susâ€¢tained period of time. \r\nTen years allow time for the superintendent to take advantage of retirements and other terminations to start institutionâ€¢ali2ing the notion of a single educational profession within the school district. \r\nRedesigning a school district or any other social institution is indeed a challenge. It\'s ironic that the person who is providing the most pUblicity about making fundamental changes in the structure of organizations is Chairman Mikhail Gorbachev with his drive for \"perestroika.\" But whether we call it redesigning, restructuring, reorganizing, or even \"perestroika,\" the next few years will provide Â·many exciting opportunities for the members of the International Society for System Sciences who are able to cross the boundâ€¢aries of the\'disciplines and fields and draw ideas from many sources to create models for tomorrow\'s institutions. \r\n,. \r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n1. 	\r\nNational Commission on Excellence in Education, A Nation .

Goodwin and Mooney credited the success of the negotiations to the new \"Win-Win\" or \"Principled\" negotiations process used in the discussions. This process is based on methods developed by the Harvard Negotiation Project. \r\nGoodwin and Mooney in a joint statement t said, \"Through this process we have become a team of fellow professionals who have learned tio use the \"Win-Win\" tools well. We believe this presents the Cincinnati Public School~ with a unique opportunity to make a significant change in the climate of our syslem and in the education for children in our city.\" \r\nHighlights of the contract include: \r\nAdditional Professional Teaching and Learning Conditions -At the high school level teachers will teach fewer classes per day, providing them with more instructional time for each class. This will also decrease the number of students that a teacher will provide instruction to each day. In addition, the contract calls for minimizing the number of non-teaching duties for teachers at all levels. Non-teaching personnel will cover as many of these responsibilities as possible, allowing teachers to devote more time to educational activities, as well as time for tutoring and advising their students. \r\nEnhancement of Teaching As a Profession -The Board and CFT are both committed to improving the profession of teaching. They envision teaching as a profession which offers opportunities for professional growth, involvement in decision making, communication, collaboration, increased responsibilities combined with accountability. Both parties are committed to designing and implementing a career in teaching program. By implementing a change in the organization of schools, teachers will have the opportunity to take on greater responsibilities which will bring with it greater status, higher salary, opportunities to collaborate, as well as leadership roles to improve instruction and student achievement. A career in teaching program is a way to give incentives to attract and keep quality teachers in the profession. It will include four levels: intern, resident, career, and lead teacher. A joint Federation/Administrative committee will be formed to develop the specifics of such a program and present it to the Board and Federation by August 1, 1988. \r\n-moreâ€¢\r\n\r\nEditorials \r\n\r\nCINCINNATI POST 2/15/88 \r\nDid the students win? \r\n\r\nThe landmark contract ratiâ€¢fied last week by the Cincinnati Federation ot Teachers and the board ot education institutes a new cooperative relationship between the teachers union and the Cincinnati public schools. Both sides have Invested great hopes In their pioneering partâ€¢nership. The publlc must walt and see whether the new apâ€¢proach w1ll deliver better schools. \r\nThis contract was reached by a novel negotiating process called \"win-win.\" It replaces the traditional tug-ot-war over fixed pOSitions with a broad disâ€¢cussion ot problems and joint crafting of solutions. These soâ€¢lutions must respect the essenâ€¢tial principles and practical constraints (including budget l1mltations) ot both sides. \r\nThe result is a striking victory for the Cincinnati Federation of Teachers -and a victory hard earned. For years, under the leadership of president 70m Mooney, the CFT has raised isâ€¢sues of educational quality 2.nd advocated sound positions -ofâ€¢ten in the face of silence and inertia from the district. It has long tried through collective barga1n1ng to win a say in eduâ€¢cational deciSions. \r\nThe union now has secured that. Joint CFT-districtcomâ€¢mittees, for example, wlll design a career ladder for teachers and deSignate interns, residents, caâ€¢reer teachers and lead teachers. Lead teachers wlll take on extra responsib1l1ties for an extra stiâ€¢pend. \r\nImproving professional conÂ· ditions for teachers was a goal of both the union and the board. The new contract wisely relieves teachers of many nonâ€¢classroom duties. But both s1des also seek to Improve learning. Thus, the contract reduces teachers\' class load from six to five a day -and makes class periods longer, Increasing time for math or Engl1sh by up to 25 percent. \r\nWill an educational partnerâ€¢ship work when only one side answers to the voters? The disâ€¢trict and the union point to a successful experiment already under way. \r\n\r\nUnder a peer appraisal system won by the CFT through collecâ€¢tive bargaining, experienced teachers are now assessing new teachers\' performance. The reâ€¢sults show they are serious about standards: Peer review is dism1ssing inadequate teachers at twice the rate of the old adâ€¢ministrative reviews. \r\nThe new contract can be equally successful if the CFT means what Tom Mooney says -echoing the union\'s national leader, Albert Shanker -about being a protesslonal association devoted to Improving education, not just a narrow advocate of higher pay and benefits. Indeed, Cincinnati teachers can no lonâ€¢ger make a strong case for being underpaid. Raises of 4 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent In the next three years will make them competitive with other publ1c school teachers and many proâ€¢fessionals In Greater Cincinnati. They have always earned more than teachers 1n paroch1al schools. \r\nBut this contract gives the CFT a share in district goverâ€¢nance regardless of who is presâ€¢Ident. It strengthens the union materially and symbol1cally by granting it the r1ght to collect an \"agency fee\" from the 15 perâ€¢cent of teachers who now. choose not to become dues-payâ€¢Ing members. \r\nOn both sides, there are skepâ€¢tics about the new partnership.They see Old-style confrontaâ€¢tion between management and labor as truer to reality. \r\nBut these are changing times, when partiCipatory manageâ€¢ment Is bringing surprising reâ€¢sults In Industry -and when public schools need to fully enâ€¢list their teachers\' best efforts. \r\nWe hope the CFT and the Cincinnati public schools will prove the doubters wrong. \r\n\r\nENQUIRER 2/14/88 \r\nTeachers\' contract: No conflict this time \r\n\r\nBY KRISTA RAMSEY The Cincinnati Enquirer \r\nIn February, 1985, Cincinnati ,Federation of Teachers announced plans for a one-day strike to draw attention to contract negotiaÂ· tions. \r\n\"The board has left us with no choice but to do something dramatic,\" CFT president Tom Mooney told reporters. \r\nIn February, 1988, the teachers and adÂ· ministration offered a community by now used to hard-fought negotiations something equally dramatic -a contract settled, they said, by collaboration instead of conflict. \r\n\"It signals a clean break with past pracâ€¢tices of confrontation,\" Mooney said this time. \r\nSo how did things evolve so nicely? \r\nOddly enough, these seeds of solution were sown in earlier upheaval. \r\nTeacher strikes in 1967 and 1977 had left a legacy of distrust and hard feelings for negotiators of the 1985 contract. AdministraÂ· tors came to the table skeptical; teachers came prepared to wage their campaign before the public. \r\n\"We both attempted to use the media to get leverage for our positions,\" said Lynn Goodwin, deputy superintendent of business and flnance. \"But the CFT used it very skillfully. \r\ni\'59MiI\' \r\n\r\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE CÂ·1 \r\nevaluations, the agreement offered \r\nboth sides a chance to work with \r\n-rather than confront -each ; other. \r\n, \"In the agreement we reached on class size were the seeds of \'win-win\' negotiating,\" the joint approach used in this year\'s conâ€¢tract, Mooney said. \r\nNo filter needed \r\n\"It was an artful compromise, \r\nand it got us into the heart of \r\nday-to-day communication,\" he \r\nsaid. \r\n\"It made us believe we could \r\ntalk to each other, not just through \r\nthe public.\" \r\nWhile the two sides worked \r\ntogether on solving such basic \r\nproblems, the deadline for 1987 \r\nnegotiations approached. \r\nWith it came new resolve to \r\nflnd a better way to settle things. \r\n\"We didn\'t want a taste in our \r\nmouths like the last contract left,\" \r\nGoodwin said succinctly. \r\nBoard member jerry Lawson \r\nwrote a newspaper column calling \r\nfor a more positive tone in negotiaâ€¢\r\ntions; fellow member Virginia Grifâ€¢\r\nfin set up breakfasts between the \r\ntwo groups to encourage more \r\ncontact. \r\nThen, former teacher Virginia \r\nRhodes was elected to the board of \r\neducation. \r\n\"That had to be a message to \r\nthe board that they had to take a \r\nlook at our point of view,\" Mooney \r\nsaid. \r\nAnd in a second new arrival -\r\nSuperintendent Lee Etta Powell \r\n-the district got, in Goodwin\'s , words, \"a chief administrator who ,! dl)esn\'t feel threatened by an inâ€¢I\\\'olved, active group of teachers.\" \r\nOne of Powell\'s early moves was to name Goodwin the board\'s chief negotiator, ensuring that teachers could negotiate face-to-face with an administrator, not with an attorney as they had in the past. \r\n\"There had to be some symbolâ€¢ic move for us to believe things were going to change,\" Mooney said. \"And we had alwa}\'s had a good relationship with Lynn. \r\n\"It had become evident that anything under Lynn\'s jurisdiction, we could work out.\" \r\nTeachers as professionals The final predictor of future success was the new, more profesâ€¢sional role the teachers carved out for themselves. By lining up squarely on the side of career ladders and peer appraisal programs, teachers conâ€¢vinced themselves and the adminâ€¢istration that they were ready for professional status. \"We took on new responsibiliâ€¢ties,\" Mooney said. \"We had to bite that bullet before we gained more credibility.\" \r\nOnce such factors were in place, both the teachers and the board started searching for a means to smoother negotiations. And both came back with the same solution. \r\nTheir choice -Conflict Manâ€¢agement Inc., a part of the Harâ€¢vard Negotiation Project -is a system that trains negotiating parties to decide both items to be discussed and solutions in a joint manner. \r\nGoodwin uses an illustration to explain the theory behind the so-called \"win-win\" bargaining: \r\nTwo sisters squabble over a single orange, Their mother cuts \r\n\"We lost that war -public sentiment for the positions was clearly on the side of the CFT.\" \r\nIn addition to a public relations campaign, the teachers\' union filed complaints of unfair labor practices, lobbied parents for support and, as a flnal weapon, threatened a one-day walkout. \r\nThe strike never materialized. A contract was settled hours before it was set to begin. \r\nBut in that contract, say Mooney and Goodwin, lay the beginnings of a new relationâ€¢ship between teachers and the administration. \r\nBy establishing joint ccrrunittees to adâ€¢dress such issues as class size and teacher (Please see WIN, Page C-2) \r\nthe fruit in half to settle the -disâ€¢\r\nagreement. , \" \r\nOne daughter uses the peel\'10 \r\nmake a cake and throws away the \r\nfruit.

From beginâ€¢ning to end, contracts talks were free of confrontation. Both sides believe the process produced a contract that is objectively fair. \r\nThe new negotiating procedure is called \"win-win\" -which means that both sides have an opportunity to realize their reasonable objectives. The ultimate test will be whether it turns out to be a \"win-win-win\" conâ€¢tract, in which the winners include the public and the young people for whom the schools exist. \r\nTeachers get raises amounting to 4%, 5% and 7% during the contract\'s three years. Eighty additional teachers are to be hired, many teachers will be relieved of non-teachâ€¢ing duties, high school classes will be lengthened and the teaching load reâ€¢duced. All told, the contract will cost the school district an additional $40 million over three years -which was District tax levy was devised. \r\nThe school board abandoned its longstanding opposition to the agency shop. Henceforth, teachers who are not members of the CFT will be obliged to pay a fee to the union for its services as their bargaining agent. This was a major victory for the teachers -although, in \"win-win\" negotiations, bargainers do not think in terms of winners and losers. \r\nThere are other features of the contract that CFT officials view as long strides toward enhancing teacher professionalism. CFT assumes, in the process, a share of the responsibility for eliminating teachers who fall short of professional standards. \r\nAt the end of three years, Cincinnaâ€¢tians can look back and assess the usefulness of the technique the school board and the union used to arrive at the agreement and atÂ· the spirit in which its provisions will have been carried out. If educational standards are truly enhanced, everyone will have won. \r\nENQUIRER February 11, 1988 \r\n\r\nSchool unions OK contracts \r\n\r\n,BY KRISTA RAMSEY \r\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer \r\nUnions for both teachers and clerical workers ratified contracts with Cincinnati Public Schools Wednesday, crediting a new sysâ€¢\r\n. tern of \"win-win\" bargaining with \r\nsmooth negotiations. \r\nThe board of education will vote \r\non the proposals later this week .. \r\nHighlights of the pact affecting \r\n3,300 teachers include reductions \r\nin class and pupil loads at the high \r\nschool level, salary increases of \r\n16% over the next three years and \r\na career ladder that increases \r\nteachers\' role in policy making. \r\nAt a press conference announcâ€¢\r\ning terms of the contract Monday, \r\nCincinnati Federation of Teachers \r\npresident Tom Mooney said the \r\nteachers\' contract will increase inâ€¢\r\nstructional time for students and \r\noffer \"new leadership roles for our \r\nbest teachers.\" \r\nLater, Nancy Cavanaugh, a Cillâ€¢\r\nton kindergarten teacher, praised the career development proposal: \r\n\"I\'ve been in the classroom for 17 years and my choices were limited before. \r\n\"The career ladder is an opporâ€¢tunity for older teachers to get an increase in pay and for all. teachers to gain more respect.\" \r\nBut Suzanne Voos, a math teacher at Roselawn/Condon Eleâ€¢mentary School, was most pleased with the in-school planning period: \r\n\"I have six classes a day so the extra time will really help. \r\nThe Association of Cincinnati Public School Office Personnel -\'â€¢representing 500 secretaries, comâ€¢puter programmers and clerks â€¢agreed to a 4% pay increase for each of the next three years. \r\nThe contract also provides addiâ€¢tional pay and vacation increases for long-time employees and fundâ€¢ing for career development. \r\nACPSOP president lannis Robâ€¢ertson said the plan \"gives our people a sense that they can go to school and progress.\" \r\nTeresa Mitchell, a secretary at \r\nthe School for the Creative and \' Performing Arts, praised the setâ€¢tlement . \r\n\"I think the pay raise is fair, especially with the longevity increâ€¢ments and added vacation,\" she said. I \r\nTotal cost for the clerical work-: ers\' contract is estimated at $3 \' million for three years. The teachers\' contract will cost $40 million for the same period. \r\nRepresentatives for both unions \r\n\'and the administration praised the \"win-win\" bargaining techniques used in the settlement. Using this process, neither side comes to neâ€¢gotiations with a predetermined position; both sides work together to identify negotiating items and eventual solutions. \r\n.1 \r\n:\\~:\"~\'! \'.\' \r\n\r\n.. , -/\r\n.ak , SlT1\"\"3\'1\'\"n .. \r\n\r\n\r\n\'Win-win\' pact: a lesson for labor \r\n\r\nBy Dennis love Post staff reporter \r\nIt was a study In extremes. Striking Metro bus workers, with neâ€¢gotiations at an Impasse, braved the evening ch1ll Monday to march through downtown CinCinnati. Meanwhlle, Cinâ€¢cinnati pubUc school teachers, with a tentative agreement reached tor a new three-year contract, tlguratively warmed their feet by the tire. \"It\'s hard to compare the two sltua~ tlons,\" Tom Mooney, president of the Cincinnati Federation of Teachers, said Monday. Yet the contrast was clear. \"The main difference In the two Is that the teachers were dealing with a school board that was w1ll1ng to sit down and arrive at an agreement,\" Robert Baker, president ot Local 627 ot the \r\nAmalgamated Transit Union, said at the Monday rally at Government Square. \"We haven\'t had that luxury.\" \r\nBut some ot those involved with the teacher contract give credit to a style ot negotiation called \"win-win,\" a bargainâ€¢Ing tramework developed by the Harvard Negotiating ProJect. That approach reâ€¢places traditional, or .\"poslt1onal\" negoâ€¢tiating strategy with problem-solving principles. \r\nCincinnati Is believed to be the tlrst \r\nurban school district In the nation to try \r\nthe new concept, whose most notable \r\nsuccess came In the Camp David acâ€¢\r\ncords. \r\nSuccess ot t.he win-win approach with the teachers\' contract was even more Impressive In view of the pOisoned atmoâ€¢sphere In which the 1984 agreement was reached. That process was characterized by a long stalemate that nearly resulted In a work stoppage -circumstances similar to the current bus strike. \r\n\r\n\"Our last setUement was very comâ€¢bative,\" Mooney said. \"The relationship (between the teachers\' union and the school board) historically had been very uneven.\" \r\nThat environment changed with the Introduction ot win-win. Lynn Goodwin, deputy superintendent ot Cincinnati Publ1c Schools and chlet negotiator durâ€¢Ing the talks, said the key was \"a serious commitment to Improve our relationâ€¢ship with each other.\" \r\nStill, \"I don\'t know that we had as high an expectation as the reallty we ended up with,\" he said. \"Certainly our results exceeded my best hopes.\" \r\nI _.

The purposes of school restructuring are to improve the quality of instruction and student achievement. School restructuring will require greater site autonomy and control over budgets, shared decision making among staff members, parents and students, and appropriate accountability standards for student outcomes.\' \r\nBELIEF STATEMENTS \r\nThe Board of Education establishes the following set of belief statements that are the rationale for promoting school restructuring: \r\nBeliefs About Change \r\no 	We believe that school restructuring is not a passing fad but is a long-term strategic planning effort to improve the quality of student instruction by changing the organization of schools. \r\n\r\no 	We believe that the environment for change must allow for flexibility and \r\nrisk taking. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeliefs About Students \r\n.1. ~ \r\nr \r\no 	We believe all students can learn and that public education should enable \r\nall students to fulfill their unique potential. i \r\n\r\n\r\no 	We believe all students deserve to be at school, that each child should feel welcomed by the school staff, and that each student should achieve success at school. \r\n\r\no 	We believe that students learn in different ways, and that current \r\ninstructional methods must change to meet each student\'s learning needs. \r\n\r\n\r\no 	We believe that with the rapid increase in knowledge, students must learn to effectively process information and become lifelong learners. \r\n\r\no 	We believe that parental involvement is an essential element \'of effective \r\nstudent learning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeliefs About Schools \r\no 	We believe that the school is the locus of change. \r\n\r\no 	We believe that schools should have greater autonomy and foster shared decision making among administrators, teachers, classified staff, and parents. \r\n\r\no 	We believe that greater school autonomy and shared decision making must be accompanied by the acceptance of responsibility and accountability for student learning. \r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Policy Statement on School Restructuring Page 2 \r\nBeliefs About Schools (Continued) \r\no 	We believe that changes in school organization, instructional practices, and staff roles will occur in phases and that they will need time to evolve. It will take several years before major change is evident. \r\n\r\no We believe that schools can restructure within their resource allocations. \r\n\r\n\r\nBelief ~District Organization \r\no 	We believe that the district organization exists to set district goals and objectives, provide support and help for schools, establish district standards, and assist schools in assessing results. \r\nBeliefs Abo~ Changing Roles \r\no 	We believe that desired change in school must have significant involvement from teachers and place primary emphasis on teaching and the instructional process. \r\n\r\no 	We believe that principals should lead all employees in schools to create an environment for change by encouraging collaboration, shared decision making, and team work involving parents, students and the community. \r\n\r\no 	We believe that granting schools greater autonomy and encouraging shared decision making, collaboration, and team work will change the roles not only of school staffs, parents, and students but also of board members, employee organization leaders, cabinet members, and district certificated and classiâ€¢fied support staff. Relationships must become more enabling, supportive, and empowering. \r\n\r\n\r\nBelief About San Diego City Schools \r\no 	We believe San Diego City Schools is in a unique position to be a model for school restructuring nationally given the composition of students, quality of staff, and district reputation for innovation. \r\nREQUIREMENTS \r\nThe Board of Education encourages schools to explore new and more effective ways to educate students and to request changes or waivers of present requirements that unnecessarily restrict schools. Until such changes are made or waivers granted, schools will need to adhere to the following requirements: \r\no 	Work to achieve district goals \r\n\r\no 	Adhere to board policy \r\n\r\no 	Conduct activities that are legal and ethical \r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Policy Statement on School Restructuring Page 3 \r\nREQUIREMENTS (Continued) \r\no 	Adhere to collective bargaining agreements \r\n\r\no 	Operate within resource allocations \r\n\r\no 	Avoid activities that negatively impact other schools \r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE OR WAIVER PROCESS \r\nThe Innovation and Change Leadership Group will assist schools with requests to waive local, state, and federal policy, laws, regulations, and collective bargaining agreements to facilitate school restructuring efforts. The Innovation and Change Leadership Group will recommend for approval waivers or adjustments to policies or agreements to the Board of Education or the appropriate employee organization. \r\nPROCESS AND PLANNING \r\nThe Board of Education establishes the following as important for each restructuring school to observe: \r\no 	Commit to the purpose and belief statements of the Board of Education\'s restructuring policy. \r\n\r\no 	Engage in broad-based shared decision making involving the school administration, faculty, staff, parents, and students as appropriate. \r\n\r\no 	Engage in a planning process to create a vision statement, define school needs, establish goals and priorities, design implementation plans, and develop measures of success and an ongoing assessment process. \r\n\r\no 	Establish goals and implementation plans for improved student learning which are as good or better than what currently exists. \r\n\r\no 	Apply for a change or waiver as necessary. \r\n\r\no 	Seek additional outside funds and in-kind contributions to support restructuring if needed. \r\n\r\n\r\nBOP:lg RA10lll-3 \r\n\r\nSAN DIEGO CITY SCHOOLS \r\nOffice of the Deputy Superintendent \r\n\r\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION ON \r\nPROPOSED POLICY STATEMENT ON SCHOOL RESTRUCTURING \r\nAugust 31 t 1988 \r\n\r\nIssue/Concern \r\nThe superintendent and Board of Education are encouraging schools to engage in a school restructuring process. This process eventually will affect the roles and responsibilities of the entire school district community. The board establishes this policy to reflect the common agreements in the district about the definition/purpose t beliefs t and parameters of school restructuring. \r\nBackground \r\nOn June 9t 1987 t the Schools of the Future Commission presented its report t Which Way to the Future? San Diego and its Schools at a crossroads t to the school district community at a regular Board of Education meeting. This blue ribbon citizens commission called for a \"fundamental restructuring of schools to experiment with new approaches and organization that help all students attain productive futures.\" \r\nThe Board of Education approved the \"Initial staff response to the \'Schools of the Future\' Commission report recommendations\" on July 28 t 1987. The superintendent and board accepted the commission\'s findings and outlined initial follow up steps to the panel\'s major recommendations. One step charged the superintendent with establishing an Innovation and Change Leadership Group \"to develop a comprehensive plan for implementing various elements of school reform.\" The superintendent established this leadership group ofÂ· twenty-seven members on October 19 t 1987 t appointing ten teacher and ten administrator representatives t one Board of Education member t two Schools of the Future Commission members t two Parent Teacher Association members, one Dropout Prevention and Recovery Round Table member t and one local university school of education member. \r\nAs one of its first activities t the Innovation and Change Leadership Group sponsored a series of seminars on school restructuring with the San Diego County Office of Education t University of San Diego, San Diego State UniversitYt and Association of California School Administrators. The four seminars featured the executive director of the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy and principals t teachers, and district Â·officials from three large urban school systems across the country who are at the forefront of the school restructuring movement. Attended by over one hundred school and central office staff, these seminars provided the background information and momentum to launch a major school restructuring initiative. \r\nA number of activities took place during school year 1987-88 to support school \r\nrestructuring initiatives. The superintendent, his top administrative staff, \r\nand the Board of Education met for three half-day and one two-day session to \r\nstudy and discuss school restructuring concepts. The Innovation and Change \r\nLeadership Group met monthly to design districtwide school restructuring \r\norientation and training workshops. Teams of administrators t teachers, school \r\nBackground Information on \r\nProposed Policy Statement on \r\nSchool Restructuring Page 2 \r\nsite staff and parents from thirty-eight interested schools met for a full-day workshop on Saturday April 16, 1988, to learn about and consider school restructuring possibilities. Immediately following the end of the traditional school, from June 27-30, similar teams from twenty-five of these schools attended a four-day seminar to receive training in a strategic planning process to be used with their school communities in considering restructuring proposals. In addition to school activities, central office divisions have conducted workshops with their staffs to consider how their roles will change and how they can best support schools engaged in the restructuring process. \r\nAs a result of the seminars, workshops, retreats and other activities conducted during the 1987-88 school year, consensus on a definition/purpose statement, a set of belief statements, and a short list of parameters has emerged that form a policy statement on school restructuring. \r\nPrepared by Bertha O. Pendleton and Ron Ottinger \r\nBOP:lg RA8111-2 \r\nSAN DIEGO CITY SCHOOLS \r\nOffice of the Deputy Superintendent \r\n\r\nTHE RESTRUCTURING PROCESS \r\nAugust 31, 1988 \r\n\r\nThe basic purpose of restructuring is to empower schools to develop successful life long learners and to make schools better. The school becomes the fundamental decision making unit but operates within a framework which assures school equity and accountability. Schools maintain a responsibility for carrying out the district mission, policy, and goals but have flexibility in determining how they can be achieved. Restructuring schools follow a strategic planning process. \r\n1. \r\nImproving the Knowledge Base \r\n\r\nMaking teachers, principals and other staff knowledgeable is an obvious first step in enhancing their power. The more knowledgeable all staff are the more able they will be to escape their isolation and gain a more global view. Principals, teachers and parents should read pertinent research literature, participate in discussion groups, listen to speakers in the field, participate in workshops and seminars which will provide basic knowledge and training about restructuring concepts. Informal and formal arrangements are encouraged. This kind of preparation seems necessary to engage in planning a particular restructuring proposal and in creating a climate for change. Learn all you can! Working in a collegial fashion may represent a new approach for some groups. Time spent in training, deveâ€¢loping skills for consensus building, goal setting, and group dynamics is generally well spent. \r\n\r\n2. \r\nDeveloping! -Vision and Goals \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this phase, the school staff supported by School Operations Division will want to meet, discuss, and develop consensus around their vision for what skills, knowledge, and attitudes the future student of their school will need to master. Then, given the economic, social, demographic and technological changes that characterize this era, they must agree on a vision of what their school must be like to meet these needs. This involves collection of data on the academic, social, health, and economic needs of the students. \r\nCreating a vision may require several meetings and the involvement of various resource persons and materials. School Operations Division will assist in coordinating these resources, including support such as that provided by the Matsushita Foundation. Once a vision is established and a notion of the goals that will move the school toward achieving it, the group will want to agree on what to do first and what will be the measurable indicator(s) of success. Specific student outcomes are needed to assess progress and direction of the group\'s work. For good communication and easy reference, it makes sense to commit the vision statement(s) and goals to writing. They will become the framework for the school\'s work over the next several years. By this point in the planning process, it is a good idea to do an informal assessment of the staff commitment to this idea. Support of at least a two-thirds majority of the staff and strong commitment from parents ensure ownership of the vision and planning process. \r\nÂ· , \r\nThe Restructuring Process Page 2 \r\n3. Developing and Implementing Strategies \r\nUsing the data that has been collected about their students and school, and the vision of where they want to go, the group will want to gather as much information as possible about program ideas, including what others have tried, the context of their implementation, and what success was realized. Initial thinking about changes may include ideas such as changing approaches to instruction and curriculum, changing the school organization, restructurâ€¢ingstaff roles, and new approaches to decision making. Change should not be thought about for change sake but as a necessary modification to meet certain goals. School Operations Division would be able to form an interâ€¢divisional ad hoc support council to discuss and probe the initial proposals of the school group, assist in assessing impact on divisions, resolve issues, and identify waiver needs. The full exploration of the various options should help the group to select strategies which are both feasible and more specifically focused on the goals the group has in mind. Development of a detailed plan may be best accomplished through subcommittees working on different components. As strategies are selected, the group should agree up front on what they will regard as successful accomplishment. These bench marks will provide continuous feedback on progress. \r\nAll plans should be forwarded to the Innovation and Change Leadership Group for information and coordination. Where exceptions to policy, regulations, or contract provisions are desired, the school would request the Innovation and Change Leadership Group to review and recommend changes to the Board of Education and/or appropriate employee groups. \r\n4. Launching the Plan \r\nGood restructuring plans are never final but are in a constant state of refinement to be responsive to changing student, staff, and community needs. At some point the group reaches a critical mass with regard to the vision, some feasible goals, and a priority set of program ideas to work on. It is important to test that consensus by securing the commitment of two-thirds of the staff and support from parents. This should culminate in the formal establishment of the school governance council representative of staff and parents. \r\nHaving satisfied itself with a reasonable background of knowledge, a manageable task, collective will, and a self correcting capacity, the group should begin implementation. School Operations Division and the interdivisional team can help the group in assessing its readiness for moving ahead or considering additional restructuring. \r\n5. Evaluating and Reviewing the Plan \r\nAs the staff implements the plan, it will gain insight and experience for making revisions. It is important to make this review a structured part of the process. A good plan is kept dynamic and helps participants feel they are important to shaping it along the way. \r\nBOP:1g RA8311-2 \r\n'),(5019,95,2,50,0,'Proposed policy on school restructuring'),(7073,94,2,50,0,'Tentative agreement between the Boston school committee and the Boston teachers union'),(7074,94,2,49,0,'Education Reform'),(7075,94,2,41,0,'Tentative agreement between the Boston school committee and the Boston Teachers Union'),(7076,94,2,39,0,'Boston Teachers Union'),(7077,94,2,48,0,'Boston Teacher\'s Union,.

The collection has documents from the national headquarters; over 30 affiliate locals and state federations of the AFT as well as 70 personal collections.

For general questions about this project please use the site\'s <a href=\"contact/\" title=\"Contact Us\">contact form</a>.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Antecedents to Education Reform project is an artificial collection from the AFT historical collection for this website that has identified papers, correspondence, memos, contract language, documents, and reports from AFT locals that introduce reform elements through collective bargaining and joint labor/management cooperation from the 1980s â€“ the late 1990s.  For example some documents found on this site will be the Toledo Plan for Peer Review, Professional Education Program from Pittsburgh and Dade County Shared Decision Making program.   The site also contains speeches from AFT presidents and AFT policy and reports on education reform that supported various education initiatives during the 1980s and early 1990s. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The criteria for selecting documents by the AFT archivist and with consultation from the AFT were geography of the local, development of education reform, and type of reform element as well as amount of content to share with the general public. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>About the Project</h2>\r\n<p>Antecedents to Education Reform Historical Collection is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://reuther.wayne.edu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Walter P.
